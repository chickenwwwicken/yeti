If u try to set value of key that already exists, 
U just update the value of that key.

``` python
full_names = ["jack bronson", "james mcarty", "jack denver"]
def make_dict(full_names):
	# create empty dictionary
	names_dict = {}
	for full_name in full_names:
	    # split full_names
	    names = full_name.split()
	    # assign first string to first_name
	    first_name = names[0]
	    # assign second string to last_name
	    last_name = names[1]
	    # assign dict[key] = value
	    names_dict[first_name] = last_name

	print(names_dict)
# {
#   'jack': 'denver',
#   'james': 'mcarty'
# }
```
