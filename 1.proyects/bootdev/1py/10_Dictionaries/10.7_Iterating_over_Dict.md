We can iterate over a dictionary's keys using the same no-index syntax we used to iterate
over the values in a list.
With access to the dictionary's keys, we also have access to their corresponding values.

``` python
fruit_sizes = {
    "apple": "small",
    "banana": "large",
    "grape": "tiny"
}
# we can use any word instead of 'name'
# we are also assigning keys as 'name'
for name in fruit_sizes:
	# assigning values as 'size'
    size = fruit_sizes[name]
    # using both variables assigned: 'name' + 'size'
    print(f"name: {name}, size: {size}")
    
# name: apple, size: small
# name: banana, size: large
# name: grape, size: tiny
```
