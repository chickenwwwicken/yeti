You've probably encountered some errors.
Two main kinds of distinguishable errors.
- syntax error
- exceptions
### Syntax Errors
Python interpreter telling you that your code isn't adhering to proper syntax.

``` 
this is not valid code, so it will error
      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

### Exceptions
Even if right syntax, may still give error when executing
Errors detected in execution are called "exceptions" and can be handled by ur code.
U can even raise ur own exceptions when bad things happen in code.

Python uses a `try`-`except` pattern for handling errors.

``` python 
try:
  10 / 0
except Exception:
  print("can't divide by zero")
```

The `try` block is executed until an exception is raised or it completes, whichever first.
In this case, an exception is raised because division by zero impossible.
The `except` block is only executed if an exception is raised in the `try` block.

If we want to access the data from the exception, we use this syntax:

``` python
try:
  10 / 0
except Exception as e:
  print(e)

# prints "division by zero"
```

Wrapping potential errors in `try/except` blocks allows the program to handle exception
without crashing


sooo... instead of this

``` python
def main():
    print(get_player_record(1))
    print(get_player_record(2))
    print(get_player_record(3))
    print(get_player_record(4))
```

u get this

``` python
def main():
    try:    
        print(get_player_record(1))
        print(get_player_record(2))
        print(get_player_record(3))
        print(get_player_record(4))
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```
