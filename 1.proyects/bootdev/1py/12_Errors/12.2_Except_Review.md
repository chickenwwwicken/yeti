``` python
try:
  10 / 0
except Exception as e:
  print(e)

# prints "division by zero"
```

The `try` block is executed until an exception is raised or it completes.
Whichever happens first.

In this case 'divide by zero' error is raised because it's impossible.

The `except` block is only executed if an exception is raised in the `try` block.

It then exposes the exception as data (`e` in our case) so that the program can handle
the exception gracefully without crashing.

If no exceptions are raised in the `try` block...
the except block won't execute.

If an exception is raised outside of a `try` block...
the program crashes and prints the exception.
