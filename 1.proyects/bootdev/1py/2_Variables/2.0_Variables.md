#### Print Command
``` python
# texts
print("Whatever u wanna print")
# numbers
print(1)
# math
print(1+1)
```

#### Creating Variables
``` python
new_variable = 1
```

#### None is NOT a specific string
NoneType is not the same as a string with a value of "None" 

``` python
my_none = None # None type
my_none = "None" # string
```

#### Concatenation 
``` python
first_name = "Lane "
last_name = "Wagner"
full_name = first_name + last_name
print(full_name)
# prints "Lane Wagner"
```

#### Declaring Variables on the Same Line
``` python
sword_name, sword_damage, sword_length = "Excalibur", 10, 200

# this is the same as :

sword_name = "Excalibur"
sword_damage = 10
sword_length = 200
```

#### Adding multiple variables Format
``` python
average_score = (
    game_one_score
    + game_two_score
    + game_three_score
    + game_four_score
    + game_five_score
    + game_six_score
