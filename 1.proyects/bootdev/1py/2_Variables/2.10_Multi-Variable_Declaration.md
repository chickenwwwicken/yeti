We can save space when creating many new variables by declaring on the same line 
``` python
sword_name, sword_damage, sword_length = "Excalibur", 10, 200
```

Any number of variables can be declared on the same line,
and variables declared on the same line should be related in some way to one another 
so that the code remains easy to understand
