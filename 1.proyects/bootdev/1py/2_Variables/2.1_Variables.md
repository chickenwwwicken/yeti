Variables are how we store data in our program. 
So far we've been directly printing data by passing it directly into the ```print()``` function

Now we gonna learn to save the data in variables so we can use and change before printing.

A variable is a name that we define that will point to some data.
For example, I could define a new variable called ```my_height``` and set its value to 100.
I could also define a variable called ```my_name``` and set  it equal to "Lane".

#### Creating Variables
Use following syntax

``` python
new_variable = 1
any_name = 25
```
