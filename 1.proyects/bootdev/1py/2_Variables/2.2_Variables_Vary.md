Variables are called "variables" because they can hold any value and that value can change.

For example, the following will print ```20```:
``` python
acceleration = 10
acceleration = 20
print(acceleration)
```

The second line reassigns  the value of ```acceleration``` to 20.
It  overwrites whatever was being held in the first line of ```acceleration```

another example:

``` python
player_health = 1000

player_health = player_health - 100

print(player_health)

player_health = player_health - 100

print(player_health)

player_health = player_health - 100

print(player_health)

player_health = player_health - 100

print(player_health)

# this prints:
# 900
# 800
# 700
# 600
```
