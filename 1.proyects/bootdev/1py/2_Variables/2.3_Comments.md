Comments don't run like code, they are ignored by the computer. 
Comments are useful for adding reminders or explaining what a piece of code does.

#### Single line comment
``` python
# speed is a variable describing how fast is player
speed = 2
```

####  Multi-line comments (docstrings)
``` python
"""
	the  code found below 
	will print 'Hello, World!' to  the console
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

This is useful if you don't want to add the ```#``` to the start of each line when writing comments
