Variable  names can't  have spaces. 
They are continuous strings of character

In python you should use "snake_case" when creating variable names - 
it's become the "rule of thumb" for the language.
You should generally try to conform your casing and style to the conventions of whatever
language you are programming in.

By way of comparison, "camelCase" is where the beginning of each new word except the
first is capitalized. 

#### Casing Examples
##### No casing (insanity) 
```
somevariablehere = 10
```

##### Camel Case
```
someVariableHere = 10
```

##### Snake Case
```
some_variable_here = 10
```
