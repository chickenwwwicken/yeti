In Python  there are several  basic data types

#### String Type
"Strings" are  raw text  in coding speak. 
They are called "strings" cuz they are a list of characters strung together.
Strings are declared in Python by using single or double quotes.

``` python
name_with_single_quotes = 'boot.dev'
name_with_double_quotes = "boot.dev"
```

#### Numeric Types
Numbers aren't surrounded by quotes when created, but they can have decimals and
negative signs.

##### Integers are numbers without a decimal
``` python
x =  5
y = -5
```

##### Floats are numbers with decimals
``` python
x = 5.1
y = -5.2
```

#### Boolean Type
A "Boolean" is a type that can only have one of two values: ```True``` or ```False``` 
``` python
is_computer = True
is_not_computer = False
```
