Not all variables have a value.
We can declare an "empty" variable by setting it to [None](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None) 

#### What is None?
```None``` is a special value in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value. 
 It is not the same as zero, False, or an empty string.

``` python
empty = None
```

#### None is NOT a specific string
NoneType is not the same as a string with a value of "None" 

``` python
my_none = None # None type
my_none = "None" # string
```

It is a keyword used to define an empty or "null" value variable or object.
