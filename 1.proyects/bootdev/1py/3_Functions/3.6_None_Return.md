When no return value is specified in a function, it will automatically return ```None```.
For example, maybe it's a function that prints some text to the console,
but doesn't explicitly return a value.
The following code snippets all return the same value, ```None```:

``` python
def my_func():
    print("I do nothing")
    return None
```

``` python
def my_func():
    print("I do nothing")
    return
```

``` python
def my_func():
    print("I do nothing")
```

If there's no return line in the function, it returns ```None```
If after ```return``` there's nothing, it returns ```None```
If there's ```return None``` it returns ```None```
