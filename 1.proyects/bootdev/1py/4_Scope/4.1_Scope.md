Scope refers to where a variable or function name is available to be used.
For example when we create variables in a function 
(such as by giving names to our  parameters)
This data is not available outside of that function.

``` python
def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y
result = subtract(5, 3)
print(x)
# ERROR! "name 'x' is not defined"
```

When the ```subtract```  function is called, we assign ```5``` to the variable ```x```,
but ```x``` only exists in the code within the ```subtract``` function.
Trying to  use it outside of it will give you error.
