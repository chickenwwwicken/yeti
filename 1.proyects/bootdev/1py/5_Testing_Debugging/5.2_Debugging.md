That first part of the process is called debugging. 
You write some code,  run it, and if it doesn't work, you fix the bugs.
You repeat this process until  you're confident that your code works as expected.

You should be debugging your code using the ```run``` button. 
You should be adding ```print()``` statements to your code to make sure it's doing
what you think it's doing at different points in the code

- write a line  to calculate a value
- ```print()``` the value you calculated.
- Run the code
- Did it print what you expected. if not fix it
- Repeat
