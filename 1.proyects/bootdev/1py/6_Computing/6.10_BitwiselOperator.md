Bitwise "or" "|" operator is similar to the bitwise "and" operator working on binary rather
than boolean values.
However , the bitwise "or" operator "or"s the bits together

``` python
0101
|
0111
=
0111
```

`1` = `True`
`0` = `False` 

Bitwise operations are just a bunch of logical operations that are completed in tandem.
When two binary numbers are "or"ed together, the result has a `1` in any place where
either of the input numbers has a `1` in that place.

`|` is the "or" bitwise operator in Python 
`5 | 7 = 7` and `5 | 2 = 7` as well 

#### Assignment
A "guild" is a team of 2-4 players. Here are the guild-specific permissions:

`can_invite` - Leftmost bit (`0b1000`)
`can_kick` - Second to leftmost bit (`0b0100`)
`can_enter_dungeon` - Second to rightmost bit (`0b0010`)
`can_surrender` - Rightmost bit (`0b0001`)
When players are in a guild together, they gain all the permissions of all the other members of the guild!

For example, if:

Jack has the `can_invite` permission: `0b1000`
Jill has the `can_kick` permission: `0b0100`
Then, when they are partied together, they should both have the `can_invite` and `can_kick` permissions: `0b1100`. 

## Guild Permissions with Bitwise "or"

``` python
def calculate_guild_perms(glorfindel, galadriel, elendil, elrond):
    guild_perms = glorfindel | galadriel | elendil | elrond
    return guild_perms

# inputs
#  glor     gala     ele    elro  expected
# (0b0001, 0b0010, 0b0001, 0b1011, 0b1011)
# (0b0000, 0b0000, 0b0000, 0b1011, 0b1011)
# (0b1001, 0b0010, 0b1101, 0b1011, 0b1111)
```

Complete the `calculate_guild_perms` function. It should return a binary number that represents the permissions of all the members of the guild (Glorfindel, Galadriel, Elendil and Elrond).
