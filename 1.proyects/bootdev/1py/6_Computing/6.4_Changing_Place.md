It's common to want to change the value of variable basedd on current value
``` python
player_score = 4
player_score = player_score + 1
# player_score now equals 5
```

``` python
player_score = 4
player_score = player_score - 1
# player_score now equals 3
```

is not a valid mathematical expression
It doesn't matter, it is valid code.

expression should be read in English like:
Assign to `player_score` the current value of `player_score` minus 1
the right-hand side (`player_score - 1`) is calculated first
then we update `player_score` with this new value
