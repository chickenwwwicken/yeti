Bitwise operators similar to logical operators
Instead of operating on boolean, they apply same logic to all bits in a value by column.
``` python
0101
&
0111 # just 3 column is not True with '&' operator
=
0101
```

this is the logic:

``` python
0 & 0 = 0
1 & 1 = 1
1 & 0 = 0
```

### Guild Permissions
apps sometimes store permissions as binary values:
- `can_create_giuld` - `0b1000`
- `can_review_guild` - `0b0100`
- `can_delete_guild` - `0b0010`
- `can_edit_guild`     - `0b0001`
If user can do all = `0b1111`
