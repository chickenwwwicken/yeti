## 7.1 Compare Scores in Boolean

``` python
def player_1_wins(player_1_score, player_2_score):
    return player_1_score > player_2_score
```

Complete the `player_1_wins` function.
It should return `True` if player 1 has a higher score, and `False` otherwise.

``` python
def compare_heights(edward_height, alphonse_height, winry_height, mustang_height):
    is_mustang_edward_same = edward_height == mustang_height
    is_alphonse_edward_same = alphonse_height == edward_height
    is_winry_alphonse_same = alphonse_height == winry_height
    return is_mustang_edward_same, is_alphonse_edward_same, is_winry_alphonse_same

# inputs
#     (5, 5, 7, 5, (True, True, False)),
#     (6, 6, 5, 5, (False, True, False)),
#     (4, 4, 4, 4, (True, True, True)),
#     (2, 2, 2, 2, (True, True, True)),
#     (5, 7, 9, 11, (False, False, False)),
#     (11, 9, 7, 5, (False, False, False)),

compare_heights
```

Use comparison operators to determine their boolean values.
The context of the parameter names should tell you how to make these comparisons.
Return them in this order:

1. `is_mustang_edward_same`
2. `is_alphonse_edward_same`
3. `is_winry_alphonse_same`

##  7.2 If ==

``` python
def check_swords_for_army(number_of_swords, number_of_soldiers):
	# check if equal
    if number_of_swords == number_of_soldiers:
        return 'correct amount'
    # if not equal 
    return 'incorrect amount'
```

## 7.3 If-Else example

``` python
def player_status(health):
    if health <= 0 :
        return 'dead'
    elif health <= 5 :
        return 'injured'
    return 'healthy'
```

``` python
def check_high_score(current_player_name, high_scoring_player_name):
    if current_player_name == high_scoring_player_name:
        return "You are the highest scoring player!"
    else:
        return "You are not the highest scoring player!"
```

## 7.4 tracking hit or miss

``` python
def does_attack_hit(attack_roll, armor_class):
    if (attack_roll != 1 and attack_roll >= armor_class) or attack_roll == 20:
        return True
    return False
```

function for tracking whether a character's attack hits or misses

Function should return `True` if either of the following conditions are met:
- The `attack_roll` is not a `1` and attack roll is `>=` `armor_class`, or
- The attack roll is a `20` 

Otherwise return `False`

## 7.5 Serving Alcohol?

``` python
def should_serve_customer(customer_age, on_break, time):
    if (
        customer_age >= 21
        and on_break == False
        and time >= 5 and time <= 10
    ):
        return True
    return False

# or

def should_serve_customer(customer_age, on_break, time):
	if customer_age < 21:
		return False
	if on_break:
		return False
	if time < 5 or time > 10:
		return False
	return True
```

Complete the function that determines if a bartender should serve drinks to customer.
Only return `True` if all of these conditions apply, else return `False`:
- The customer's age is 21 or older
- The bartender is working
- The time is at least 5 but no later than 10

## 7.5 Calculate energy needed for trip

``` python
def has_enough_energy(energy_available, distance_one_way, meters_per_energy):
    energy_needed = distance_one_way * 2 / meters_per_energy
    return energy_needed <= energy_available:
```

Determine how many energy points you need to go and come back.
Assign the result to a `energy_needed` variable. 
`meters_per_energy` is how far u can travel with one energy point.

Return `True` if there is at least enough energy based on the `energy_needed` variable, 
and `False` otherwise.
