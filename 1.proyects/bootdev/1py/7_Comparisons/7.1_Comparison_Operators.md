It's necessary to be able to compare two values.
`Boolean Logic` is the name fo these comparisons that always result in `True` `False` .

The operators:

- `<` less than
- `>` greater than
- `<=`  less than or equal to
- `>=` more than or equal to
- `==` equal to
- `!=` not equal to

examples:

``` python
5 < 6 # evaluates to True
5 > 6 # evaluates to False
5 >= 6 # evaluates to False
5 <= 6 # evaluates to True
5 == 6 # evaluates to False
5 != 6 # evaluates to True
```

#### Assignment 
Complete the `player_1_wins` function.
It should return `True` if player 1 has a higher score, and `False` otherwise.

``` python
def player_1_wins(player_1_score, player_2_score):
    return player_1_score > player_2_score
```
