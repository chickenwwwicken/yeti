It's often useful to only execute code if a certain condition is met:

``` python
if CONDITION:
	# do some stuff here

# code after the if block will run regardless
```

For example in this code:

``` python
if bob_score > bill_score:
	print("Bob Wins!")

print("Game Complete")
```

if `bob_score` is greater than `bill_score`, then this will be printed:

``` python
Bob Wins!
Game Complete
```

Otherwise this will be printed:

```
Game Complete
```

#### Assignment
Complete the `print_status` function.
- If a `player_health` is `0`, print the text `dead` to the console. 
- Afterwards, whether or not the player is dead, print `status check complete`  to console.

``` python 
def print_status(player_health):
    if player_health == 0 :
        print('dead')
    print('status check complete')
```

##### Tip
Indentation matters! 
Indentation is whhat tells python whther the body of a function or the if statement has ended.
Also, don't forget the colon after your if statement, it is a required part of syntax.
