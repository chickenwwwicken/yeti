Complete the function that determines if a bartender should serve drinks to customer.
Only return `True` if all of these conditions apply, else return `False`:
- The customer's age is 21 or older
- The bartender is working
- The time is at least 5 but no later than 10

``` python
def should_serve_customer(customer_age, on_break, time):
    if (
        customer_age >= 21
        and on_break == False
        and time >= 5 and time <= 10
    ):
        return True
    return False
    
```

#### Tip - If statements don't need a comparison
The following statements are identical 
``` python
if is_big:
	# ...

if is_big == True:
	# ...
```
