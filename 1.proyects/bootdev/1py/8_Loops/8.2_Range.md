the `range()` function we've been using in our `for` loops actually has an optional 3rd parameter: the 'step'

``` python
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
	print(i)
# prints : 0,2,4,6,8
```

the 'step' parameter determines how much to add to `i` in each iteration of the loop.
You can also go backwards:

``` python
for i in range(3, 0, -1)
	print(i)
# prints : 3, 2, 1
```
