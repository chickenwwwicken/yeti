Python has another type of loop, the `while` loop.
It's a loop that continues `while` a condition remains `True`.
The syntax is simple:

``` python
while 1:
	print('1 evaluates to True')
# prints:
# 1 evaluates to True
# 1 evaluates to True
# 1 evaluates to True
# 1 evaluates to True
# ...
```

This example continues forever. Creating an infinite loop.
Typically, a `while` loop condition is a comparison or variable, 
and it determines when the loop ends:

``` python
num = 0
while num < 3:
	num += 1
	print(num)
	
# prints:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# (the loop stops when num >= 3)
```
