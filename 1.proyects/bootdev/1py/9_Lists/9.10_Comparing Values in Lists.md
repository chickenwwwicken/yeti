We keep track of each character's level in a list. 
When someone levels up, we wanna know bout it so we can congratulate em.
Assignment is to compare `old_character_levels` and `new_character_levels` lists.
Print the index where a character's level increased.

``` python
def check_character_levels():
    old_character_levels = [1, 42, 43, 53, 12, 3, 32, 34, 54, 32, 43]
    new_character_levels = [1, 42, 45, 54, 12, 3, 32, 38, 54, 32, 42]

	for i in range(0, len(old_character_levels)):
		if old_character_levels[i] == new_character_levels[i]:
			print i
```
