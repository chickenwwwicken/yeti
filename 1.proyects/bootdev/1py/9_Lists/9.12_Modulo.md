### The modulo operator can be used to find a remainder.
For example: `7` modulo `2` would be `1` 

`2` can be multiplied evenly into `7` at most three times:
`2 * 3 = 6`
Then the remaining to get  from `6` to `7` is `1`

The modulo operator is the percent sign: `%` 
It's important to recognize modulo is not a percentage though!
That's just the symbol python uses.

``` python
remainder = 8 % 3 
# remainder = 2
```

An odd number is a number that when divided by `2` the remainder is not `0`
