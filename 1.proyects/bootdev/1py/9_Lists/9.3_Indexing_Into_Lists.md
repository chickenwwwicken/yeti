How to access a specific item in the list.
We access items in a list directly by using their index. 
Indexes start at `0` (the first item) and increment by one with each successive item.
Syntax:

``` python
best_languages = ["JavaScript", "Go", "Rust", "Python", "C"]
print(best_languages[1])
# prints "Go", because index 1 was provided
```
