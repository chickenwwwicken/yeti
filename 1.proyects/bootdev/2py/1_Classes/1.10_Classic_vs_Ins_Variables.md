## Instance Variables

Instance variables vary from object to object and are declared in the constructor.

``` python
class Wall:
    def __init__(self):
	    # INSTANCE VARIABLE
        self.height = 10

south_wall = Wall()
south_wall.height = 20 # only updates this instance of a wall
print(south_wall.height)
# prints "20"

north_wall = Wall()
print(north_wall.height)
# prints "10"
```

## Class Variables

Remain the same between instances of the same class.
Declared at the top level of a class definition.

``` python
class Wall:
	# CLASS VARIABLE
    height = 10

south_wall = Wall()
print(south_wall.height)
# prints "10"

Wall.height = 20 # updates all instances of a Wall

print(south_wall.height)
# prints "20"
```

## Instance Variable Example

``` python
class Dragon:
    def __init__(self,element):
        self.element = element

    def get_breath_damage(self):
        if self.element == "fire":
            return 300
        if self.element == "ice":
            return 150
        return 0
```
