Keeping track of all the employees. 
Create an internal tool to help them manage their employees.

#### Challenge
Your boss is asking you to use shared class variables to keep track of:
- company's name
- total number of employees
Inside the `Employee` Class

#### Class Variables
Initialize the following class variables:
- `company_name` = `Age of Dragons, Inc.`
- `total_employees` = `0`

#### Constructor
constructor should take the following parameters in order:
- `first_name = first_name`
- `last_name = last_name`
- `id = id`
- `position = position`
- `salary = salary`

Also should increment the `total_employees` class variable each time a new employee is created.
`total_employees` is a class variable not an instance variable

#### Getter
Add a `get_name` method that returns the employee's full name as a string. 


``` python
class Employee:
	company_name = "Age of Dragons, Inc."
	total_employees = 0

	def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, id, position, salary):
		self.first_name = first_name
		self.last_name = last_name
		self.id = id
		self.position = position
		self.salary = salary

		Employee.total_employees += 1
		
	def get_name(self):
		return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"
```
