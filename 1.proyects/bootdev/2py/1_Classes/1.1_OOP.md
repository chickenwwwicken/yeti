### What is Object-Oriented Programming?

OOP is a pattern for writing clean and maintainable code.
Not everyone agrees that oop are the best way to write code...

We'll be coding a real-time strategy game called "Age of Dragons" 
Players control armies of people, elves, orcs, and dragons and battle.

## OOP and Functional Programming

these are all about making code easier to work with and understand.
Code that's easy to understand is called 'clean code'

- make your programs function correctly
- only occur in oop

### Clean code does

- make code easier to work
- make it easier to find and fix bugs

- help retain sanity

## Destroying Walls

``` python
def destroy_walls(walls_health):
    for w in walls_health:
        if w <= 0:
            walls_health.remove(w)
    return walls_health
```
