A class is a special type of value in an OOP language like Python.
It's similar to a dictionary in that it usually stores other types inside itself.

### Class

``` python
# Defines a new class called "Soldier"
class Soldier:
    health = 5
    armor = 3
    damage = 2
```

Just like a string, integer, or float, a class is a Type.
But they are custom types that you define. 

An object is just ann instance of a class type
Example:

### Instance

``` python
health = 50
# health is an instance of an integer type
aragorn = Soldier()
# aragorn is an instance of the Soldier type (class)
```

"Classes" are custom new types that we define as the programmer.
Eachh new instance of a class is an "object".

### Example

``` python
class Archer:
    health = 40
    arrows = 10

# Create several instances of the Archer class
legolas = Archer()
bard = Archer()

# Print class properties
print(legolas.health) # 40
print(bard.arrows) # 10
```
