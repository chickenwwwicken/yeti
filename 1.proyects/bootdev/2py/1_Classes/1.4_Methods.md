One thing that makes classes cool is that we can define methods on them.
A method is a function that's tied directly to a class and has access to its properties
Method is a function that is tied to a Class and has Access to it. 

### Method

Methods are nested within the `class` declaration. 
Their first parameter (self) is always the instance (soldier_one) of the class that the method is being called on.

``` python
class Soldier:
    health = 5

    def take_damage(self, damage):
        self.health -= damage

soldier_one = Soldier()
soldier_one.take_damage(2)
print(soldier_one.health)
# prints "3"
```

### Self

By convention it's called "self".
`self` is a reference to the object. 

``` python
my_object.my_method()
# exactly the same as 
self.my_method()
```

### Class and Method Example

`fortify()` method  doubles current `armor` property.

``` python
class Wall:
	armor = 10
	height = 5

	def fortify(self):
		self.armor *= 2
```

works because its inside the class.
