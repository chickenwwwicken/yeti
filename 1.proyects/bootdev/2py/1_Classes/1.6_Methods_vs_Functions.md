A method has all the same properties as Function.
But it is tied directly to a class and  has access to all its properties.

A method automatically receives the object it was called on as its first parameter.

``` python
class Soldier:
    health = 5

    def take_damage(self, damage, multiplier):
        damage = damage * multiplier
        self.health -= damage

dalinar = Soldier()
damage, multiplier = 30, 3

# Only "damage" and "multiplier" are passed as arguments
# "dalinar" is passed implicitly as the first argument, "self"
dalinar.take_damage(damage, multiplier)
```

A method can operate on data that is contained within the class.
In other words, you won't always see "outputs" in the `return` statement because maybe 
just mutating the objects properties directly.
