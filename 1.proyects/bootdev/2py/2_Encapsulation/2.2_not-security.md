Encapsulation is the practice of hiding code complexity inside a "black box" 
so that other devs don't have to worry about it.

It does not make the code more secure in a cryptographic or cyber-security sense. 

**Encapsulation is about organization,,, not security**

Encapsulation is like folders in an unlocked filing cabinet. 
They don't stop someone from peeking inside, 
but they do keep everything tidy and easy to find.
