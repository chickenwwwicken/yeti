Python is dynamic language, 
makes it difficult for the intepreter to enforce some of the safeguards that static languages do. 
That's why encapsulation in Python is achieved mostly by convention rather than by force.

Prefixing methods and properties with a double underscore is a strong suggestion to the users of your class that they shouldn't be touching that stuff.
If a dev wants to break convention, there are ways to get around the double underscore.
