Players can recruit wizard pupils into their armies.
Depending on the pupil's marks, they gain different in-game abilities.

### Assignment
Complete the `Student` class

#### Constructor 
Should set the `name` parameter to the `name` instance variable.

Should initialize private data member called `__courses` to an empty `dictionary` 

#### `calculate_letter_grade` method
should take a `score` as a parameter.

- if `score` is 90 or above, func should return `A`
- If `score` is between 80 and 89, func should return `B`
- If `score` is between 70 and 79, func should return `C`
- If `score` is between 60 and 69, func should return `D`
- Else, function should return `F`

#### `add_course` method
should take a `course_name` and `score` as parameters.
- should  `calculate_letter_grade` based on the `score`
- should set the `course_name` as key in the `courses` dictionary and the calculated letter grade as the corresponding value. 

#### `get_courses` method
should return the private `__courses` dictionary.

``` python
class Student:
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name
		self.__courses = {}

	def calculate_letter_grade(self, score):
		if score >= 90:
			return "A"
		elif score >= 80:
			return "B"
		elif score >= 70:
			return "C"
		elif score >= 60:
			return "D"
		else:
			return "F"

	def add_course(self, course_name, score):
		# gets grade from method
		grade = self.calculate_letter_grade(score)
		# creates a key value pair in __courses dict
		self.__courses[course_name] = grade

	def get_courses(self):
		return self.__courses
```
