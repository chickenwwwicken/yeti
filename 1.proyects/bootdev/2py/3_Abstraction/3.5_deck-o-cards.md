Finish the `DeckofCards` class.
The `SUITS` and `RANKS` of each card have been provided for you as class variables.

#### Constructor

1. Initialize a `private` empty list called `cards` .
2. Fill that empty list by calling the `create_deck` method within the constructor.

#### `create_deck(self)` 
This method should create a `(Rank, Suit)` tuple for all 52 cards in the deck and append them to the `cards` list. 

Order matters. 
The cards should be appended to the list in the following order:
all ranks of hearts, then diamonds, then clubs, and finally spades.
Within each suit, the cards should be ordered from the lowest rank (Ace) to the highest (King).

#### `shuffle_deck(self)` 
This method should use the `random.shuffle()` method to shuffle the `cards` in the deck.

#### `deal_card(self)`
This method should `pop()` the first card off the top of the deck (end of the list) and return it.
If there are no cards left in the deck the method should instead return `None` .
