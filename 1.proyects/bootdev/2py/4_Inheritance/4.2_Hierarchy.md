There is no limit to how deeply we can nest an inheritance tree. 
For example, a `Cat` can inherit from an `Animal` that inherits from `LivingThing` .
That said, be careful! New programmers often get carried away.

You should never
"Well most wizards are elves ... so I'll just have wizard inherit from elf"

A good child class is a strict subset of its parents class. 

A child class cannot simply access a private property of its parent class. 
It has to use a getter. 
For example: 

``` python
class Wall:
	def __init__(self, height):
		self.__height = height

	def get_height(self):
		return self.__height

class Castle(Wall):
	def __init__(self, height, towers):
		super().__init__(height)
		self.towers = towers

	def get_tower_height(self):
	return self.get_height() * 2
```

### Assignment
Let's add a new game unit: `Crossbowman` .
A crossbowman is always an archer, 
but not all archers are crossbowmen. 
Crossbowmen have several arrows, but they have an additional method: `triple_shot()`
1. Add a `use_arrows(self, num)` method to the `Archer` class. It should remove the `num` arrows If there aren't enough arrows to remove, it should raise a `not enough arrows` exception
2. The `Crossbowman` class's constructor should call its parent's constructor.
3. The crossbowman's `triple_shot` method should use `3` arrows.
4. The crossbowman's `triple_shot` method takes a `target` as a parameter and returns `{} was shot by 3 crossbow bolts` where `{}` is the name of the `Human` that was shot. 


``` python
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name


## don't touch above this line


class Archer(Human):
    def __init__(self, name, num_arrows):
	    ## super() - calls for inheritance, 
	    ## __init__ - initializes parent class
	    ## (name) - calls parameter of parent class
        super().__init__(name)
        ## creating a new variable with num_arrows only cuz name is inherited from Human class
        self.__num_arrows = num_arrows

    def get_num_arrows(self):
        return self.__num_arrows

    def use_arrows(self, num):
        if self.__num_arrows < num:
            raise Exception('not enough arrows')
        self.__num_arrows -= num


class Crossbowman(Archer):
    def __init__(self, name, num_arrows):
	    ## calls for Archer Parent class : so we have both parameters of parent class 
        super().__init__(name, num_arrows)

    def triple_shot(self, target):
	    ## calls method from parent class use_arrows, 
	    ## add 3 for triple shot
        self.use_arrows(3)
        ## calls the get_name method from Human class for "target" parameter (which is a Human)
        return f"{target.get_name()} was shot by 3 crossbow bolts"

```
