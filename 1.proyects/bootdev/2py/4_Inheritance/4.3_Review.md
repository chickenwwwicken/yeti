5### Basic Inheritance in code

``` python
class RealEstate:
	def __init__(self, location):
		self.__location = location

class Residential(RealEstate):
	def __init__(self, location, bedrooms):
		super().__init__(location)
		self.__bedrooms = bedrooms

class House(Residential):
	def __init__(self, location, bedrooms, yard_size):
		super().__init__(location, bedrooms)
		self.__yard_size = yard_size
```

There can be infinite inheritance levels to a hierarchy tree.
