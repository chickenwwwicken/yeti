Usually, inheritance hierarchies form trees, not lines.
A parent class can have multiple children. 

### Assignment

The `Archer` class should inherit from `Hero` .
Fulfill the following requirements from the game designers:

- `Archer` should inherit from `Hero` 
- `Archer` should set up the hero's name and health
- Set a private "number of arrows" variable that can be passed in as a third param to constructor
- Create a `shoot` method that takes a target hero as input. If there are no arrows left, raise a `not enough arrows` exception. Otherwise, remove an arrow and deal `10` damage to the target hero. 

``` python
class Hero:
	def __init__(self, name, health):
		self.__name = name
		self.__health = health

	def get_name(self):
		return self.__name

	def get_health(self):
		return self.__health

	def take_damage(self, damage):
		self.__health -= damage

class Archer(Hero):
	def __init__(self, name, health, num_arrows):
	self.__num_arrows = num_arrows

	def shoot(self,target):
	if self.__num_arrows < 1:
		raise Exception("not enough arrows")
	self.__num_arrows -= 1
	## using take_damage method on target parameter.
	target.take_damage(10)
```

# Part 2

Wizard heroes are more powerful than archer heroes. 
They cast spells at other heroes instead of shooting them,
and casting does `25` damage instead of `10` but also costs `25` mana. 

Fulfill the following requirements: 

- `Wizard` should inherit from `Hero` 
- `Wizard` should set up the hero's name and health
- Set a private "mana" variable that can be passes in as a third parameter to the constructor.
- Create a `cast` method that takes a target hero as input. If there is not enough mana left, raise a `not enough mana` exception. Otherwise, remove `25` mana from the wizard and deal `25` damage to the target hero.

``` python
class Wizard(Hero):
	def __init__(self, name, health, mana):
		super().__init__(name, health)
		self.__mana = mana

	def cast(self, target):
		if self.__mana < 25:
			raise Exception("not enough mana")
		self.__mana -= 25
		target.take_damage(25)
```
