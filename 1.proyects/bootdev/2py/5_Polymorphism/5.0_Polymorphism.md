While inheritance is the most unique trait of OOP languages,
polymorphism is probably the most powerful.
Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, 
function or object to take on multiple forms.

For example, 
classes in the same hierarchical tree may have methods with the same name but different behaviors. 

### Shapes

``` python
class Creature():
    def move(self):
        print("the creature moves")

class Dragon(Creature):
    def move(self):
        print("the dragon flies")

class Kraken(Creature):
    def move(self):
        print("the kraken swims")

for creature in [Creature(), Dragon(), Kraken()]:
    creature.move()
# prints:
# the creature moves
# the dragon flies
# the kraken swims
```

The `Dragon` and `Kraken` child classes are overriding the behavior of their parent class's `move()` method.

## Hit-Box
We're going to build hit-box logic for our game step by step, 
starting with a simple `Rectangle`.

Complete the `__init__()` method.
Configure the class to have properties matching the variables passed into the constructor in this order. 

### 1. Constructor

``` python
class Rectangle:
	def __init__(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):
		self.__x1 = x1
		self.__y1 = y1
		self.__x2 = x2
		self.__y2 = y2
```

### 2. Get Edges
With a dragon, because they big. we're going to check if the dragon's body (a rectangle) is within the fire (also a rectangle still) .
The image below contains an example of fire breath hitting a dragon. 

![[Pasted image 20240919142259.png]]

The coordinates have been made private members.
First, let's set up some helper methods.

Write the following methods. 
What they do should be self-explanatory

Using `min()` and `max()` will give you min and max values from parameters,
also works with an iterable, 

- `get_left_x()`
- `get_right_x()`
- `get_top_y()`
- `get_bottom_y()`

``` python
    def get_left_x(self):
        return min(self.__x1, self.__x2, key=None)

    def get_right_x(self):
        return max(self.__x1, self.__x2, key=None)

    def get_top_y(self):
        return max(self.__y1, self.__y2, key=None)

    def get_bottom_y(self):
        return min(self.__y1, self.__y2, key=None)
```

### 3. Check Overlap
`overlaps()` method should check if this rectangle overlaps a given rectangle, `rect`.
Return `True` if this rectangle overlaps any part of `rect`, 
including just touching sides, `False` otherwise.

Conditions that must be `True` if this Rectangle (A) overlaps or touches `rect` (B).

- A's left side is on or to the left of B's right side.
- A's right side is on or to the right of B's left side.
- A's top side is on or above B's bottom side.
- A's bottom side is on or below B's top side.

``` python
    def overlaps(self, rect):
        return(
            self.get_left_x() <= rect.get_right_x() and
            self.get_right_x() >= rect.get_left_x() and
            self.get_top_y() >= rect.get_bottom_y() and
            self.get_bottom_y() <= rect.get_top_y()
        )
```

### 4. Bringing it Together
The `Dragon` class should override the Unit class's `in_area` method. 
Instead of checking if the center position of the Dragon is in the given area, 
we'll check if its big dragon body overlaps with the given area. 

First complete the Dragon's constructor. 
The dragon needs one more private data member: `__hit_box` .
The hitbox is a `Rectangle` object. 
You've been provided with height, width, and center position (pos_x and pos_y).

Example:

![[Pasted image 20240919150339.png]]

`in_area() method()`
Next, you'll need to override the `in_area` method that the `Dragon` class
inherited from the `Unit` class. 
In the `Dragon` class' `in_area` method, 
create a new rectangle object with the given corner positions,
and use the rectangle's `overlaps` method to check if the Dragon's 
`self.__hit_box` is inside it. 
This method should return a boolean value. 

#### Dragon Class

``` python
class Dragon(Unit):
    def __init__(self, name, pos_x, pos_y, height, width, fire_range):
        super().__init__(name, pos_x, pos_y)
        self.fire_range = fire_range
        self.height = height
        self.width = width
        # creating a Rectangle hitbox with x1, y1, x2, y2
        self.__hit_box = Rectangle(
            pos_x - width / 2,
            pos_y - height / 2,
            pos_x + width / 2,
            pos_y + height / 2
        )

    def in_area(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):
	    # also creating a new Rectangle object for the tests, so there's input to be compared with the __hit_box 
        area_rectangle = Rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        # seems like you can use methods from other classes 
        return area_rectangle.overlaps(self.__hit_box)
```

#### Composition
This is where you include an instance of one class inside another, 
allowing you to call its methods. 
In this exercise we have Rectangle class used inside the Dragon class. 
By creating an instance of Rectangle within the Dragon classs,
you get to use its methods

#### Passing Objects
you can also pass an object of one class to a method of another class, 
enabling interaction between them. 

#### Utility Classes or Helper Methods
Sometimes a class provides utility methods that are used by various other classes. 
Such classes don't need to inherit from another but can use these methods freely.
