Another kind of built-in polymorphism in python is the ability to override how an operator works. 

For example, the `+` operator works for built-in types like integers and strings. 

``` python
print(3 + 4)
# prints "7"

print("three " + "four")
# prints "three four"
```

Custom classes on the other hand don't have any built-in support for those operators: 

``` python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y


p1 = Point(4, 5)
p2 = Point(2, 3)
p3 = p1 + p2
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Point' and 'Point'
```

However, we can add our own support!
If we create an `__add__(self, other)` method on our class, 
the Python interpreter will use it when instances of the class are being added with the `+` operator.
Here's an example

``` python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, point):
        x = self.x + point.x
        y = self.y + point.y
        return Point(x, y)

p1 = Point(4, 5)
p2 = Point(2, 3)
p3 = p1 + p2
# p3 is (6, 8)
```

Now, when we execute this, under the hood the Python interpreter just calls:
`p1.__add__(p2)`

### Adding Weird shit with `__add__()`
In age of dragons, players can upgrade their weaponry. 
To make "crafting" simple for other devs, 
we'll use operator overloading in the `Sword` class. 

Note how the test suite attempts to use the `+` operator to craft the swords.

Overload the `+` operator to craft the swords.

Create and `__add__(self,other)` method on the `Sword` class. 
It will be used to craft two swords together to create a new sword. 
Return a new `Sword` instance. `sword_type` is just a string, one of:
- `bronze` 
- `iron` 
- `steel` 
- if two bronze are crafted = return iron sword
- if two iron crafted = return steel sword
- if player tries anything other than two bronze or iron, raise exception "can not craft" 

``` python
class Sword:
    def __init__(self, sword_type):
        self.sword_type = sword_type

    def __add__(self, other):
        if self.sword_type == other.sword_type == "bronze":
            return Sword("iron")
        if self.sword_type == other.sword_type == "iron":
            return Sword("steel")
        raise Exception("can not craft")
```
