let's take a look at some of the built-in methods we can overload in Python. 

While there isn't a default behavior for the arithmetic operators like we just saw, 
there is a default behavior for printing a class. 

``` python
class Point:
	def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y


p1 = Point(4, 5)
print(p1)
# prints "<Point object at 0xa0acf8>"
```

That's not useful!!

Let's teach instances of our `Point` object to print themselves. 
The `__str__` method lets us do just that. 
It takes no inputs but returns a string that will be printed to the console when someone passes an instance of the class to Python's `print()` func. 

``` python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return f"({self.x},{self.y})"

p1 = Point(4, 5)
print(p1)
# prints "(4,5)"
```

NOTE: the `__repr__` method works in a similar way. 

### Using `__str__`
When `print()` is called on an instance of a `Dragon`,
the string `I am {0}, the {1} dragon` should be printed. 

- `{0}` is the name
- `{1}` is the color

``` python
class Dragon:
    def __init__(self, name, color):
        self.name = name
        self.color = color

    def __str__(self):
        return f"I am {self.name}, the {self.color} dragon"
```
