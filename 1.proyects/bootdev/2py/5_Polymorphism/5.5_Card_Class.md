Complete the `Card` class. 

``` python
import random

SUITS = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]

RANKS = ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"]


class Card:
    def __init__(self, rank, suit):
        pass

    def __eq__(self, other):
        pass

    def __lt__(self, other):
        pass

    def __gt__(self, other):
        pass

    # don't touch below this line

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.rank} of {self.suit}"
```

1. Define a constructor that takes `rank` `suit` as params and sets `rank` , `suit`, `rank_index`, `suit_index` instance variables

You will need the indexes of the `ranks` and `suits` to help you compare them against each other. 
Keep in mind that a rank and a suit are just strings within a list. 

2. Overload the comparison operators. 

Overload the following comparison operators :
- `==` : eq
- `>` : gt
- `<` : lt

#### Ranking the Cards
A card is greater than another card if it has a higher rank.
However, if the ranks are the same, 
the card with the higher suit is greater than the other card. 
This same logic applies to the "less than" operator.
The "equal to" operator should check that the rank and suit are equal.

The suits and ranks are defined as global variables.
The lower the index, the lower the rank or suit.

#### Tips
The `.index` list method is very useful when trying to determine the index of an element on a list. 

``` python
import random

SUITS = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]

RANKS = ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"]


class Card:
    def __init__(self, rank, suit):
        self.rank = rank
        self.suit = suit
        self.rank_index = RANKS.index(rank)
        self.suit_index = SUITS.index(suit)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.rank_index == other.rank_index and self.suit_index == other.suit_index

    def __lt__(self, other):
        if self.rank_index == other.rank_index:
            if self.suit_index == other.suit_index:
                return False
            return self.suit_index < other.suit_index
        return self.rank_index < other.rank_index

    def __gt__(self, other):
        if self.rank_index == other.rank_index:
            if self.suit_index == other.suit_index:
                return False
            return self.suit_index > other.suit_index
        return self.rank_index > other.rank_index
```
