Functional programming is a style of programming where we compose functions instead of mutating state (updating the value of variables).

-  Functional programming is more about declaring what you want to happen, rather than how you want it to happen
- Imperative or Procedural programming declares both the what and the how

### Examples of imperative code

``` python
car = create_car()
car.add_gas(10)
car.clean_windows()
```

### Examples of functional code:

``` python
return clean_windows(add_gas(create_car()))
```

The important distinction is that in the functional example,
we never change the value of the `car` variable, we just compose functions that return new values, 
with the outermost function, 
`clean_windows` in this case, returning the final result.

### Doc2Doc
In this course, we're working on "Doc2Doc" , a cli tool to convert file formats.

## Assignment
Complete the `stylize_title` function.
It should take a single string as input, 
and return a single string as output. 
The returned string should have both the title centered and a border added.

- use the provided `center_title` and `add_border` functions.
- center the title before adding the border.
- do not create any variables
- use only 1 line of code in the function body.

``` python
def stylize_title(document):
    return add_border(center_title(document))


# Don't touch below this line


def center_title(document):
    width = 40
    title = document.split("\n")[0]
    centered_title = title.center(width)
    return document.replace(title, centered_title)


def add_border(document):
    title = document.split("\n")[0]
    border = "*" * len(title)
    return document.replace(title, title + "\n" + border)

```
