Functional programming aims to be declarative.
We prefer to declare what we want the computer to do, 
rather than muck around with the details of how to do it.

Let's take an extreme example and pretend we wanted to style a webpage with CSS

---
## Declarative Styling
The following CSS changes all button elements to have red text:

``` css
button {
	color: red;
}
```

It does not execute line-by-line like an imperative language. 
Instead, it simply declares the desired style, 
and it's up to a web browser to figure out how to apply and display it. 

---
## Imperative Styling
Unlike functional programming and CSS, a lot of code is imperative.

We write out the exact step-by-step implementation details.
This Python script draws a red button on a screen using the Tkinter library:

``` python
from tkinter import * # importing the library
master = Tk() # creating a window
master.geometry("200x100") # setting the window size
button = Button(master, text="Submit", fg="red").pack() # create a button
master.mainloop() # start the event loop
```
