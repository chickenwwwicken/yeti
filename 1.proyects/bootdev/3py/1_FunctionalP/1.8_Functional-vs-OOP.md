Functional programming and object-oriented programming are styles for writing code.
One isn't inherently superior to the other, 
but to be a well-rounded  dev you should understand both well and use ideas
from each when appropriate. 

You'll encounter devs who love func programming and others who love oop programming.
However, contrary to popular opinion, 
FP, and OOP are not always at odds with one another. 
They aren't opposites. 

Of the four pillars of OOP, 
inheritance is the only one that doesn't fit with func programming.

Inheritance isn't seen in func code due to the mutable classes that come with it. 
Encapsulation, polymorphism and abstraction are still used all the time in func prog.

When working in a language that supports ideas from both FP and OOP 
Like (python, javascript, or go) the best devs are the ones who can 
use the best ideas form both paradigms effectively and appropriately.
