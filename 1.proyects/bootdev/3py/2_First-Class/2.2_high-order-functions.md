A programming language 'supports first-class functions' 
when functions are treated like any other variable.

That means functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, 
can be returned by other functions, 
and can be assigned to variables.

- **First-class function** : A function that is treated like any other value 
- **Higher-order function**: A function that accepts another function as an argument or returns a function

Python supports first-class and higher-order functions.

### First-Class Function example

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

# Assign function to a variable
f = square

print(f(5))
# 25
```

### Higher-order Function example

#### func for  square-ing a list of integers (can also work for more funcs)

``` python
def square(x):
    return x * x

def my_map(func, arg_list):
	# new list
    result = []
    for i in arg_list:
        # iterate over the list, func the list, create a new list with func results
        result.append(func(i))
    return result

squares = my_map(square, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(squares)
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
