"Map", "filter", and "reduce" are three commonly used [[Higher-Order-Functions]] in functional programming.

In Python, the built-in map function takes a function and an iterable (in this case a list) as inputs. 
It returns an iterator that applies the function to every item, yielding the results.

With `map`, we can operate on lists without using loops and nasty stateful variables.
For example: 

``` python
def square(x):
    return x * x

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_nums = map(square, nums)
print(list(squared_nums))
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

The list type constructor `list()` converts the `map` object object back into a standard list.

### Assignment
Markdown supports two different styles of bullet points, `-` and `*` . 
We prefer `*`, so, we need a function to convert any `-` bullet points to `*` bulletpoints.

Complete the `change_bullet_style` function. 
It takes a document (a string) as input, and returns a single string as output.
The returned string should have any that start with a `-` character replaced with a `*` character.

For example this:

``` 
- This is a bullet
- This is a bullet
```

Becomes

```
* This is a bullet
* This is a bullet
```

Use the built in map function to apply the provided `convert_line` function to each line of the inpuut string. UUse the `.split()` and `.join()` to split the document into a list of lines, and then join the lines back together. This should preserve the original line breaks. Don't use the `.replace()` string method.

### Examples of `.split()` and `.join()`

``` python
# my_document is a string with newlines
lines_list = my_document.split("\n")
rejoined_doc = "\n".join(lines_list)
```

## Splitting a doc into lines // changing a value of the lines // .joining doc together 

```python
# step by step x chicken
def change_bullet_style(document):
	lined_doc = document.split("\n")
	test = map(convert_line, lined_doc)
	rejoined_doc = "\n".join(test)
	return rejoined_doc
```

``` python
# all in one slick oneliner
def change_bullet_style(document):
	return "\n".join(map(convert_line, document.split("\n")))
```

``` python
# changing a value in the line
def convert_line(line);
	old_bullet = "-"
	new_bullet = "*"
	if len(line) > 0 and line[0] == old_bullet:
		return new_bullet + line [1:]
	return line
```
