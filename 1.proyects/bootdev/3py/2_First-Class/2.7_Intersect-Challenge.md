The `.intersection()` method calculates thhe intersection of two sets.

	The intersection of two sets is a new set that contains all of the elements that are in both original sets

Foor example: 

``` python
a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
b = {3, 4, 5, 6}
c = a.intersection(b)
print(c)
# {3, 4}
```

### Assignment

Coomplete thhe `get_common_formats` function using the `.intersection()` method. 
It should take in two arguuments, `formats1` and `formats2`, 
each a list of strings representing the file formats supported by two different pieces of software.

It should return a set of strings representing the file formats that are supported by both pieces of software.

## Get a common set of values from two lists or sets

``` python
def get_common_formats(formats1, formats2):
	return set(formats1).intersection(set(formats2))
```
