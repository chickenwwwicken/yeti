In mathematics, an [integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral) is the continuous analog of a sum, which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations. 

Integration, the process of computing an integral, is one of the two fundamental operations of calculus, 
the other being differentiation. 

Integration was initially used to solve problems in mathematics and physics, such as finding the area under a curve, or determining displacement from velocity. 

Usage of integration expanded to a wide variety of scientific fields thereafter. 


A definite integral computes the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line.

Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function; a function whose derivative is the given function; 

in this case, they are also called indefinite integrals. 

The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integration to differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known; differentiations and integration are inverse operations. 



Although methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into infinitesimally htin vertical slabs. in the early 20th century, Henri Lebesgue generalized Riemann's formulation by introducing what is now referred to as the Lebesgue integral; it is more general than Riemann's in the sense htat a wider class of functions are Lebesgue-integrable.
