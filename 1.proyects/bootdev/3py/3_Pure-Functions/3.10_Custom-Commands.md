Doc2Doc is customizable. New commands can be configured to use whichever function suits the user. 
However, the new commands are causing bugs in other parts of the app by mutating global variables and other unintended side effects.

### Assignment
Fix the functions `add_custom_command`, `add_format`, `save_document` and `add_line_break` to make them pure functions without side effects. Here are the reported issues: 

- `add_custom_command`: is an impure function that is mutating an input.
- `add_format`: is an impure function that is mutating an input
- `save_document`: is an impure function that is mutating an input.
- `add_line_break`: is a no-op function with a side-effect

wrong function:
``` python
default_commands = {}
default_formats = ["txt", "md", "html"]
saved_documents = {}

# Don't edit above this line


def add_custom_command(commands, new_command, function):
    commands[new_command] = function
    return commands


def add_format(formats, format):
    formats.append(format)
    return formats


def save_document(docs, file_name, doc):
    docs[file_name] = doc
    return docs


def add_line_break(line):
    print(line + "\n\n")
```

### Configurable commands for the user

``` python
default_commands = {}
default_formats = ["txt", "md", "html"]
saved_documents = {}

# Don't edit above this line


def add_custom_command(commands, new_command, function):
    commands_copy = commands.copy()
    commands_copy[new_command] = function
    return commands_copy


def add_format(formats, format):
    formats_copy = formats.copy()
    formats_copy.append(format)
    return formats_copy


def save_document(docs, file_name, doc):
    docs_copy = docs.copy()
    docs_copy[file_name] = doc
    return docs_copy


def add_line_break(line):
    line_copy = line
    return line_copy + "\n\n"
```
