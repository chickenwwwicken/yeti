At Doc2Doc we need to be able to reverse strings. 
Our bad-word detection algorithms need to work on those crazy teenagers who write unpleasantries backward to try to get around our filters!

However, being an ex-Haskell-loving university professor, our team lead has asked us to implement it using recursion instead of a loop. 

### Assignment
Complete the `reverse_string` function.

It should take a string as a parameter and return the reversed string by recursively reversing the substrings inside. Your function should recurse once for each character in the string. 

### Reversing String with Recursion

``` python
def reverse_string(s):
    if len(s) == 0:
        return ''
    return s[-1] + reverse_string(s[:-1])
```

Started by subtracting the first letter from the end `[-1]`
then added all the rest to it `reverse_string(s[:-1])`
which call by call ends up adding everything on reverse + returning it
