Recursion is super useful with tree-like structures because we don't always know how deep they're nested. Stop and think about how you would write nested loops to traverse a tree of arbitrary depth...

``` python
for item in tree:
    for nested_item in item:
        for nested_nested_item in nested_item:
            for nested_nested_nested_item in nested_nested_item:
                # ... WHEN DOES IT END???
```

I most often use recursion on tree-like problems (filesys, nested dicts, etc). 
If I'm just iterating over a one-dimensional list then a loop is typically simpler, 
even it it's not as "pure" in the academic sense. 

*Remember: The rules of functional programming are just philosophies to help you write better code, but it's not always the right tool for the job.* The same goes for any programming paradigm. 

#### Questions
What makes it hard to loop over a tree? 
- You don't know the depth of the tree (number of nested levels)
Imperative loops are allowed in purely functional code...
- False
Loops are used often by good programmers even though thhey break the academic rules of func programming...
- True
