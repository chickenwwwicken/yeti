In Doc2Doc, we might have documents nested inside other documents, forming a kind of tree. 
You know how crazy `.docx` files can get...

Anyways, we wanna find out how deeply nested a given document is.

### Assignment
Complete the `count_nested_levels` function. 

It should recursively search for the `target_document_id` in the `nested_documents` dictionary and return the number of nested levels of that document.

If the target document doesn't exist, the function should return `-1`. 
You may use loops with recursion.

### Example
In this dictionary, the document with id `3` is nested 2 levels deep.
Document `2` is nested 1 level deep. 

``` python
{
    1: {
        3: {}
    },
    2: {}
}
```

### Recursive Search for specific key in nested dictionaries + returning the level of nesting if found

``` python
def count_nested_levels(nested_documents, target_document_id, level=1):
    for doc in nested_documents:
        if target_document_id == doc: # check if we found id
            return level
        # if not found at this level, call the function again...
        found_level = count_nested_levels(nested_documents[doc], target_document_id, level + 1)    
        if found_level != -1:  # if found at this level, return the level
            return found_level
        # if not found in this branch, continue to next doc
    # if we checked everything and found nothing... return -1           
    return -1
```

1. We first check if the current document is our target
2. If not, we look deeper and save the result
3. If we found it deeper, we return that level
4. If we didn't find it deeper, we continue checking other documents
5. Only if we check everything and find nothing do we return `-1`
