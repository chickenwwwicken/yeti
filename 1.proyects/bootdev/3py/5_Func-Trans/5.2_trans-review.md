Example of a function transformation:

``` python
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def self_math(math_func):
    # inner_func is defined inside self_math.
    # It can only be referenced directly
    # inside self_math's scope. However, it is then
    # returned and can be captured into a new variable
    # like square_func or double_func, and called that way
    def inner_func(x):
        return math_func(x, x)
    return inner_func

square_func = self_math(multiply)
double_func = self_math(add)

print(square_func(5))
# 25

print(double_func(5))
# 10
```

### Questions
What does the expression of 'self_math(add)' return? 
- A function
Where can `inner_func` be referenced directly?
- Only within `self_math()`
