You might be wondering: 

- 'When would I use function transfoormations in the real world?'
- Isn't it simpler to just define functions at the top level oof the code, and call them as needed?

We don't just transform functions at runtime for the fun of it! 
We only use advanced techniques like function transformations when they make our code simpler than it would be otherwise.

### Code Reusability
Creating variations of the same function dynamically can make it a lot easier to share common functionality.
Take a loook at this `formatter` function. 
It accepts a 'pattern
' and returns a new function that formats text according to that pattern:

``` python
def formatter(pattern):
    def inner_func(text):
        result = ""
        i = 0
        while i < len(pattern):
            if pattern[i:i+2] == '{}':
                result += text
                i += 2
            else:
                result += pattern[i]
                i += 1
        return result
    return inner_func
```

Now we can create new formatters easily:

``` python
bold_formatter = formatter("**{}**")
italic_formatter = formatter("*{}*")
bullet_point_formatter = formatter("* {}")
```

And use them like this: 

``` python
print(bold_formatter("Hello"))
# **Hello**
print(italic_formatter("Hello"))
# *Hello*
print(bullet_point_formatter("Hello"))
# * Hello
```

### Closures
90% of the time, when we use func trans, it's because I want too create a closure. 
We'll talk about closures in the next chapter.

#### Questions
We should use function transformations ___
- When it results in more understandable code. 
Couldn't we just explicitly define `bold_formatter`, `italic_formatter` and `bullet_point_formatter` as normal funcs?
- Yes, but it wil probably require more code
