In programming languages, a closure, also lexical closure, or function closure, is a techniqque for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions. Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function together with an environment. The environment is a mapping associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created. Unlike a plain funcitoon,  a closure allows the function to access those captured variables through the closure's copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope.
