The whole point of a closure is that it's stateful. 
It's a function that 'remembers' the values from the enclosing scope even after the enclosing scope has finished executing. 

It's as if you're saving the state of a function at a particular point in time, and then you can use and update that state later on. 

``` python
def concatter():
	doc = ""
	def inner_func(word):
		# "nonlocal" tells Python to use the doc
		# variable from the enclosing scope
		nonlocal doc
		doc += word + " "
		return doc
	return inner_func

harry_potter_aggregator = concatter()
harry_potter_aggregator("Mr.")
harry_potter_aggregator("and")
harry_potter_aggregator("Mrs.")
harry_potter_aggregator("Dursley")
harry_potter_aggregator("of")
harry_potter_aggregator("number")
harry_potter_aggregator("four,")
harry_potter_aggregator("Privet")

print(harry_potter_aggregator("Drive"))
# Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive
```

That means that in many cases, closures are not pure functions. 
They can mutate state outside of their scope and have side effects.
