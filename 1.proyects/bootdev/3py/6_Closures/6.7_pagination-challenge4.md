Users shoould be able to paginate lengthy documents to make them manageable. 
Pagination is simply dividing a document into pages. 
This idea can also be applied to other data besides raw text, 
such as a list of search results or API responses. 

### Assignment
Complete the inner `add_word_to_pages` function. 
It takes a list of strings, `pages`, and a string `word`, as inputs and returns `pages` with the `word` added.

1. If `lines` is empty, return just `word` in a list.
2. Assign the last page in `lines` to `current_line`
3. If the length of `current_line` and `word` plus one (for a space) is more than `line_length`, start a new page by appending `word` to `lines`.
4. Else, add `word` to `current_line` with a space, and assign the new string to the last index in `pages`.

NOTE: Every page will have at least one woord, even if that word is longer than the `line_length`.

``` python
lineate = lineator(11)
lines = lineate("Boots loves salmon because he is a bear.")
# lines
: ["Boots loves", "salmon", "because he", "is a bear."]
```

### 

``` python
from functools import reduce


def paginator(line_length):
    def paginate(document):
        words = document.split()

        def add_word_to_pages(lines, word):
            if not lines: 
	            return word
	        current_line = lines[-1]
	        if len(current_line + " " + word) > line_length:
		        lines.append(word)
		    else: 
			    lines[-1] = current_line + " " + word
			return lines

        return reduce(add_word_to_pages, words, [])

    return paginate
```
