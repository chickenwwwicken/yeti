bsRemember, currying is when we take a function that accepts multiple arguments:
``` python
final_volume = box_volume(3, 4, 5)
print(final_volume)
# 60
```
And convert it into a series of functions that each accept a single argument: 
``` python
final_volume = box_volume(3)(4)(5)
print(final_volume)
# 60
```
- `box_volume(3)` returns a new function that accepts a single integer and returns a new function. 
- `box_volume(3)(4)` returns another new function that accepts a single integer and returns a new function. 
- `box_volume(3)(4)(5)` returns the final result. 
Here's another way of calling it, where each function is stored in a variable before being called: 
``` python
with_length_3 = box_volume(3)
with_len_3_width_4 = with_length_3(4)
final_volume = with_len_3_width_4(5)
print(final_volume)
# 60
```
Here are the function definitions:
``` python
def box_volume(length):
  def box_volume_with_len(width):
    def box_volume_with_len_width(height):
      return length * width * height
    return box_volume_with_len_width
  return box_volume_with_len
```
### Assignment
Doc2Doc meets to be able to find the number of lines in a document that contain a specific sequence of characters. 

For example, given the following document:
``` python
aaaa
bbbb
ccdd
aabb
```
How many lines contain the sequence 'aa'? The anwer is 2: 'aaaa' and 'aabb'.

Complete the `lines_with_sequence` function. It should return a series of curried functions so it can be called like this:
``` python
num_lines = lines_with_sequence(char)(length)(doc)
```

The sequence is generated by the first `with_char` that has been provided for you. It works like this: 

| Character | Length | Sequence |
|     'a'          |     3      |      'aaa'      |
|     'b'          |     2      |      'bb'       | 
|     '*           |     4      |      "****"    |

You need to define and return a second curried function. I called mine `with_lenght`. 
It should accept the final parameter, a `doc` string, and return the number of lines that contain the sequence. 

1. Define the `with_length` function inside the `with_char` function, it should accept  a `doc`.
2. Split the `doc` into lines.
3. Use a loop (or [reduce](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce)) to count the number of lines that contain the sequence in them. 
4. Return the count from the `with_length` function. 
5. Return the `with_length` function from the `with_char` function.

# counting lines with specific sequence of chars
with for loop
``` python
def lines_with_sequence(char):
    def with_char(length):
        sequence = char * length

        def with_length(doc):
            count = 0
            for line in doc.split('\n'):
                if sequence in line:
                    count += 1
            return count 
        return with_length
    return with_char
```
with reduce function
``` python
from functools import reduce
def lines_with_sequence(char):
    def with_char(length):
        sequence = char * length
        def with_length(doc):
            count = reduce(lambda accumulator, line: accumulator + (1 if sequence in line else 0), doc.split('\n'), 0)
            return count
        return with_length
    return with_char
```
