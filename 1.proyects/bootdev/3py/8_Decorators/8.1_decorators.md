Python decorators are just syntatic sugar for higher-order functions. 

Example: 
``` python
def vowel_counter(func_to_decorate):
    vowel_count = 0
    def wrapper(doc):
        nonlocal vowel_count
        vowels = "aeiou"
        for char in doc:
            if char in vowels:
                vowel_count += 1
        print(f"Vowel count: {vowel_count}")
        return func_to_decorate(doc)
    return wrapper

@vowel_counter
def process_doc(doc):
    print(f"Document: {doc}")

process_doc("What")
# Vowel count: 1
# Document: What

process_doc("a wonderful")
# Vowel count: 5
# Document: a wonderful

process_doc("world")
# Vowel count: 6
# Document: world
```
The `@vowel_counter` line is 'decorating' the `process_doc` function with the `vowel_counter` function. `vowel_counter` is called once when `process_doc` is defined with the `@` syntax, but the `wrapper` function that it returns is called every time `process_doc` is called. That's why `vowel_count` is preserved and printed after each time. 

### It's just Syntactic Sugar
Python decorators are just another (sometimes simpler) way of writing a higher-order function. These two pieces of code are identical:

#### With Decorator
``` python
@vowel_counter
def process_doc(doc):
    print(f"Document: {doc}")

process_doc("Something wicked this way comes")
```
#### Without Decorator
``` python
def process(doc):
    print(f"Document: {doc}")

process_doc = vowel_counter(process)
process_doc("Something wicked this way comes")
```

### Assignment
The provided `file_type_aggregator` function is intended to decorate other functions. It assumes that the function it decorates has exactly 2 positional arguments. 

Create a `process_doc` function that's decorated by `file_type_aggregator`. 
It should return the following string:
``` python
f"Processing doc: '{doc}'. File Type: {file_type}"
```
Where `doc` and `file_type` are its positional arguments. 
(See line 11 for where it's being called).

``` python
def file_type_aggregator(func_to_decorate):
    # dict of file_type -> count
    counts = {}

    def wrapper(doc, file_type):
        nonlocal counts

        if file_type not in counts:
            counts[file_type] = 0
        counts[file_type] += 1
        result = func_to_decorate(doc, file_type)

        return result, counts

    return wrapper


# don't touch above this line

@file_type_aggerator
def process_doc(file_type, doc):
	return f'Processing doc: '{doc}'. File Type: {file_type}'
```
