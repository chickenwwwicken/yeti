A Python decorator is just syntactic sugar for higher-order functions. 
"Syntactic sugar" just means "a more convenient syntax".

Not all programming languages have built-in decorators, 
but most do support higher-order functions and closures.

Some of the famous functional languages like:

- Haskell
- Erlang
- Clojure
- Lisp

do not have special syntax decorators, 
but they do have higher-order functions and closures, 
meaning the decorator pattern can still be used. 
So, if you understand those concepts, 
they will serve you well in many different languages.

#### Questions

- True
Function currying, higher-order functions, and first class functions are ___
- commonplace in most programming languages.
