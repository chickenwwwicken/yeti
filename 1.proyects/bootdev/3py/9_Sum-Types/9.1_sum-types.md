Remember when I said, "Pure functions are my favorite part of functional programming"? Well, sum types are a close second.

A "sum" type is the opposite of a "product" type. This Python object is an example of a product type:
``` python
man.studies_finance = True
man.has_trust_fund = False
```
If we add a third attribute, perhaps a `has_blue_eyes` boolean, the total number of possibilities multiplies again, to 8!

|  studies_finance	|  has_trust_fund	|  has_blue_eyes
|  True	    	    	    | 	     True		        |  True
|  True	   	    	   	    |  True		    	        |  False
|  True	    	    	    |  False	    	    	|  True
|  True	    	    	    |  False	    	    	|  False
|  False		    	    |  True	    	    	    |  True
|  False		    	    |  True	    	    	    |  False
|  False		    	    |  False		    	    |  True
|  False		    	    |  False		    	    |  False
But let's pretend that we live in a world where there are really only three types of people that our program cares about:
1. Dateable
2. Undateable
3. Maybe dateable
We can reduce the number of cases our code needs to handle by using a (admittedly fake Pythonic) sum type with only 3 possible types:
``` python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Dateable(Person):
    pass

class MaybeDateable(Person):
    pass

class Undateable(Person):
    pass
```
Then we can use the isinstance built-in function to check if a `Person` is an instance of one of the subclasses. It's a clunky way to represent sum types, but hey, it's Python.
``` python
def respond_to_text(guy_at_bar):
    if isinstance(guy_at_bar, Dateable):
        return f"Hey {guy_at_bar.name}, I'd love to go out with you!"
    elif isinstance(guy_at_bar, MaybeDateable):
        return f"Hey {guy_at_bar.name}, I'm busy but let's hang out sometime later."
    elif isinstance(guy_at_bar, Undateable):
        return "Have you tried being rich?"
    else:
        raise ValueError("invalid Person type")
```
### Sum Types
As opposed to product types, which can have many (often infinite) combinations, sum types have a fixed number of possible values. To be clear: Python doesn't really support sum types. We have to use a workaround and invent our own little system and enforce it ourselves.

### Assignment
Whenever a document is parsed by Doc2Doc, it can either succeed or fail. In functional programming, we often represent errors as data (e.g. the `ParseError` class) rather than by `raise`ing exceptions, because exceptions are side effects. (This isn't standard Python practice, but it's useful to understand from an FP perspective)

Complete the `Parsed` and `ParseError` subclasses.

- `Parsed` represents success. It should accept a `doc_name` string and a text string and save them as properties of the same name.
- `ParseError` represents failure. It should accept a `doc_name` string and an err string and save them as properties of the same name.
The test suite uses the `isinstance` function to see if an error occurred based on the class type.
``` python
class MaybeParsed:
    pass


# don't touch above this line


class Parsed(MaybeParsed):
    def __init__(self, doc_name, text):
        self.doc_name = doc_name
        self.text = text


class ParseError(MaybeParsed):
    def __init__(self, doc_name, err):
        self.doc_name = doc_name
        self.err = err

```

`ParseError` and `Parse` are like a filter to catch errors without them crashing anything. 
You need to add all the possibilities so that `ParseError` catches them without makin anything crash.
All of this works for handling errors in a more FP way, as data, instead of an immediate program-halting exceptions. 

Parse Definition
To 'parse' something means to break it down into smaller, understandable components -- 
usually with the goal of processing it in some meaningful way.
