*enum definition*: extended booleans for a fixed set of values ex. 'GREEN', 'BLUE', 'RED'.
in this case only green, blue, and red, are allowed.

*product-type definition*: when the total number of possible combinations of values is the product of the number of fields.

*many possibilities* -> hard to work with, endless if else statments

*sum-type definition:* number of possibilities is limited ex. Boolean (true, or false), or Enums

(these are also called algebraic data-types)

Doing the admittedly weird `class` and `isinstance()` thing works, but it turns out, there's a better way in some cases. If you're trying to represent a fixed set of values (but not store additional data within them) enums are the way to go.

Let's say we have a `Color` variable that we want to restrict to only three possible values:

- `RED`
- `GREEN`
- `BLUE`

We could use a plain-old `string` to represent these values, but that's annoying because we have to remember all the "valid" values and defensively check for invalid ones all over our codebase. Instead, we can use an `Enum`:
``` python
from enum import Enum

Color = Enum('Color', ['RED', 'GREEN', 'BLUE'])
print(Color.RED)  # this works, prints 'Color.RED'
print(Color.TEAL) # this raises an exception
```
Now `Color` is a sum type! At least, as close as we can get in Python.

There are a few benefits:

1. A "Color" can only be `RED`, `GREEN`, or `BLUE`. If you try to use `Color.TEAL`, Python raises an exception.
2. There is a central place to see the "valid" values for a `Color`.
3. Each "Color" has a "name" (e.g. `Color.RED`) and a "value" (e.g. `1`). The value is an integer and is used under the hood instead of the name. Integers take up less memory than strings, which helps with performance.
### Assignment
Create an `Enum` called `Doctype` with values:
- PDF
- TXT
- DOCX
- MD
- HTML

#### Tip
Don't forget to `import` the `Enum` class from the `enum` module!

``` python
from enum import Enum

Doctype = Enum('Doctype', ['PDF', 'TXT', 'DOCX', 'MD', 'HTML'])
```
