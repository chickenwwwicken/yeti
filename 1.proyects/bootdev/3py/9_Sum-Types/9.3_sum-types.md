Unfortunately, Python does not support sum types as well as some of the other statically typed languages.

Python does not enforce your types before your code runs. That's why we need this line here to `raise` an `Exception` if a color is invalid:
``` python
def color_to_hex(color):
    if color == Color.GREEN:
        return '#00FF00'
    elif color == Color.BLUE:
        return '#0000FF'
    elif color == Color.RED:
        return '#FF0000'
    # handle the case where the color is invalid
    raise Exception('Unknown color')
```
In a language like Rust we could write the same thing like this:
``` rust
fn color_to_hex(color: Color) -> String {
    match color {
        Color::Green => "#00FF00".to_string(),
        Color::Blue => "#0000FF".to_string(),
        Color::Red => "#FF0000".to_string(),
    }
}
```
Notice how there isn't any case for an unknown value? That's because the Rust code will fail to compile (a step that happens before the code runs at all) if the `Color` is a different value. This static enforcement is a huge benefit of sum types, and it's a shame we can't get that in Python.

### Questions
1. Which language does not support proper sum types?
	- python
2. Why are sum types useful?
	- you can know before you run your code that you've handled all possible cases.
