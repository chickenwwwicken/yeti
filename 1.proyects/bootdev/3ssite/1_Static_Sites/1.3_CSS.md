Cascading Style Sheets is another 'not-really-a-programming-language' that styles html elements. 
It's a way to drress up your HTML with colors, fonts, responsive layouts, animations, etc.

``` css
/* Make all <h1> HTML elements red */
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```
Or maybe we want the max-width of our paragraphs to be 50%  of the screen width:
``` css
/* Make all <p> HTML elements 50% of the screen width */
p {
  max-width: 50%;
}
```

### Assignment
Copy and paste the following CSS into a file called `styles.css` in the `public` directory. 
``` css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    background-color: #1f1f23;
}
body {
    max-width: 600px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 20px;
}
h1 {
    color: #ffffff;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}
p {
    color: #999999;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}
a {
    color: #6568ff;
}
```
Then link the `styles.css` file in your `index.html` file by adding a `<link>` tag to the `<head>` section. 
``` css
<head>
    <title>Why Frontend Development Sucks</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

You can kill your server with `Ctrl+C` and restart it:
``` css
# from inside the public directory
python3 -m http.server 8888
```
With the server running, run and submit the HTTP tests using the CLi tool.
