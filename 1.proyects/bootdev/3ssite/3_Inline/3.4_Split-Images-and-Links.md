Now that we have the extraction functions, we need to write the logic that splits the `TextNode` objects.

### Assignment
1. Create two new functions: 
- `def split_nodes_image(old_nodes):`
- `def split_nodes_link(old_nodes):`

They should behave very similarly to `split_nodes_delimiter`, but obviously don't need a delimiter or a text type as input, because they always operate on images or links respectively. Here's some example usage:
``` python
node = TextNode(
    "This is text with a link [to boot dev](https://www.boot.dev) and [to youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@bootdotdev)",
    TextType.TEXT,
)
new_nodes = split_nodes_link([node])
# [
#     TextNode("This is text with a link ", TextType.TEXT),
#     TextNode("to boot dev", TextType.LINK, "https://www.boot.dev"),
#     TextNode(" and ", TextType.TEXT),
#     TextNode(
#         "to youtube", TextType.LINK, "https://www.youtube.com/@bootdotdev"
#     ),
# ]
```
2. Write lots of tests for each. 
3. Run and submit the tests from the root of the project.

#### Pseudo Code for split_nodes_images
``` python
def split_nodes_image(text):
	result_nodes = []

	for each node in old_nodes:
		if node type is not TEXT:
		add node to result_nnodes (no changes needed)
		continue to next node

		extract all images from node's text
		if no images found:
			add node to result_nodes (no changes needed)
			continue to next node

		current_text = node's text
		for each image (alt_text, url) in extracteed images:
			parts = split current_text at image markdown, maximum 1 split
			if there's text beforee the image:
				add TextNode(before_text, TEXT) to result_nodes
			add TextNode(alt_text, IMAGE, url) tto result_nodes
			current_teext = the part after the split

		if current_text is not empty:
			add TextNode(current_text, TEXT) to result_nodes

	return result_nodes
```
