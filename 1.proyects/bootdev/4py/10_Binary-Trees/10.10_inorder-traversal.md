An "inorder" traversal is the most intuitive way to visit all the nodes in a tree. It's called "inorder" because the current node is visited between its children. It results in an ordered list of the nodes in the  tree. The following tree: 
```

```
Would be visited in this order:
```
[1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
```
### Assignment
Turns out, the data team had no idea what they were talking about, and our product lead just wanted an export of our tree in sorted order. He wants to be able to see the users in the order they signed up (and were thus given user IDs). 

**Implement the recursive `inorder` method.** Here are the algorithm's steps:
1. Recursively traverse the left subtree
2. Visit the value of the current node by appending its value to the visited array
3. Recursively traverse the right subtree
4. Return the list of nodes visited so far

``` python
class BSTNode:
	def inorder(self, visited):
		if self.left:
			self.left.postorder(visited)
		if self.val is not None:
			visited.append(self.val)
		if self.right:
			self.right.postorder(visited)
		return visited
```
