We also need a way to remove users from our BST if a user decides to delete their account. 

### Assignment
**Implement the recursive delete method.** It takes a value as an input and deletes the node with that value if it exists. Each call `return`s the new root of the tree (or subtree) after deletion. 

Notice that in the test suite the `delete` method is called like this:
``` python
bst = bst.delete(character)
```
1. Check if the current node is empty. If it is, return `None`. This represents an empty tree or a leaf node where deletion hhas already occurred. 
2. If the value to delete is less thann the current node's value:
	- If there's a left child, reecursively delete the value from the left subtree and update the left child reference with the result. 
	- Return thee current node. 
3. Iff the value to delete is greater than the current nnode's value: 
	- if there's a right child, recursively delete the value from the right subtree and update the right child reference with the result. 
	- Return the current node. 
4. If the value to delete equals thhe current node's value, we've found the node to delete:
	- If there  is no right child, return the left child. This bypasses the current nodee, effectively deleting it. 
	- If there is no left child, return the right child, accomplishing the same thing. 
	- If there are both left and right children, we need to find the new "successor": the smallest node in the right subtree, which is the value next largest after the current node's value. 
		- Find the smallest node in the right subtree by walking down the current right child's left branches until reaching a node with no left child. 
		- Replace the current node's value with this successor's value. 
		- delete the successor nnode from the right subtree by recursively calling delete. 
		- Return the current node. 

``` python
class BSTNode:
	def delete(self, val):
        # if tree empty return none
        if self.val is None:
            return None

        # if value to delete is less than current node value
        if val < self.val:
            if self.left:
                self.left = self.left.delete(val)
                return self
            return self

        # if value to delete is more than current node value
        if val > self.val:
            if self.right:
                self.right = self.right.delete(val)
                return self
            return self

        # if value to delete is found
        if val == self.val:
            # and no right node
            if not self.right:
                return self.left
            # and no left node
            if not self.left:
                return self.right
            # and theres both nodes
            if self.left and self.right:
                # finding the node that will replace deleted node
                # successor is the next largest value to deleted node
                successor = self.right
                # loop until no left nodes
                while successor.left:
                    # keep goin left 
                    successor = successor.left
                # replace current node with successor value (next largest)
                self.val = successor.val
                # delete 
                self.right = self.right.delete(successor.val)
                return self

	# don't touch below this line

	def __init__(self, val=None):
		self.right = None
		self.left = None
		self.val = val

	def insert(self, val):
		if not self.val:
			self.val = val
			return

		if self.val == val:
			return

		if val < self.val:
			if self.left:
				self.left.insert(val)
				return
			self.left = BSTNode(val)
			return

		if self.right:
			self.right.insert(val)
			return
		self.right = BSTNode(val)
```

``` 
example tree

      10
     /  \
    5    15
        /  \
       12   20
```
we want to delete the node with value 10. 
Since it has both left and right children, we need to:
1. Find the successor (12) (next largest) 
	- starting from its right node:
	- `successor = self.right`
	- go all the way left:
	- `successor = successor.left`
2. Replace the current node's value with the succcessor's value
	- node 10 becomes node 12:
	- `self.val = successor.val`
```
      12
     /  \
    5    15
        /  \
       12   20
```
3. Now there's a duplicate value 12 in the tree! to delete this tree:
	- `self.right` is the right subtree (15 n children)
	- call `delete(12)` on this subtree
	- this removes the node with value 12 from right subtree
	- `self.right = self.right.delete(successor.val)`
```
      12
     /  \
    5    15
           \
            20
```
the line `self.right = self.right.delete(successor.val)` is crucial because:
- it helps maintain the tree with no duplicates
- updates the right subtree after deletion
- maintains recursive nature of func
