A "preorder" traversal is a way to visit all the nodes in a tree. It's called "preorder" because the current node is visited before its children. This tree:

```
    > 7
        > 6
> 4
    > 2
        > 1
```

Would be traversed in this order:

```
[4, 2, 1, 7, 6]
```

Sometimes it's useful (albeit a bit slow) to iterate over _all_ the nodes in the tree. In the case of LockedIn, we've been asked to build a way to create a backup of our database indexes - this traversal will allow us to save all the data in the tree to a file.

## Assignment

**Implement the recursive `preorder` method**. It returns a list of the values in the order they are visited, and it takes as an argument the ordering of values we have visited so far.

For example, the first call to `preorder` on an entire tree would be:

```python
# an empty list is passed in the first call
bst_node.preorder([])
```

Here are the algorithm's steps:

1. Visit the value of the current node by appending its value to the visited array
2. Recursively traverse the left subtree
3. Recursively traverse the right subtree
4. Return the array of visited nodes

``` python
class BSTNode:
	def preorder(self, visited):
		visited.append(self.val)
		if self.left:
			self.left.preorder(visited)
		if self.right:
			self.left.preorder(visited)
		return visited
```
