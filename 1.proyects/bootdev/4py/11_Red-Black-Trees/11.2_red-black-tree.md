A red-black tree is kind of binary search tree that solves the "balancing" problem. It contains a bit of extra logic to ensure that as nodes are inserted and deleted, the tree remains relatively balanced. 

### How it Works
Each node in an RB Tree stores an extra bit, called the "color": either red or black. The "color" ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions. When the tree is modified, the new tree is rearranged and repainted to restore the coloring properties that constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case.

### Assignment
As it turns out, we've been inserting user records into our tree with incrementing numerical IDs (presorted data)! The app's user lookups are starting to get really slow. Let's start implementing a Red-Black tree to speed things up. 

In a normal `BST` , the child nodes don't need to know about, or carry a reference to their parent. The same is not true for Red-Black trees. 

The `RBNode` class is already implemented for you, as well as the `__init__` constructor method of the `RBTree` class. There's also a data member, `self.nil` created for you in the constructor. `self.nil` contains the value we'll use to designate all the `nil` leaf nodes, which are used for rebalancing purposes but contain no "actual" value. 

**Complete the `insert` method.** It should take a value as input and add the value as the new node in the tree if the value doesn't already exist. 
1. Create the `new_node`: 
	1. Create a new `RBNode` from the given input value
	2. The `new_node` shouldn't have a parent yet
	3. The `new_node`'s left and right children should be `nil`
	4. The `new_node` is red. (`new_node.red = True`)
2. Find the parent of the `new_node` if there wil   l be one:
	1. initialize a `parent` variable to `None`
	2. Initialize a `current` variable to the root node of the tree
	3. While `current` isn't a nil node:
		1. Set `parent` to the `current`
		2. If the `new_node`'s value is less than the `current` node's, set `current` to its own left child. If `new_node`'s value is greater, set `current` to its own right child. If the values are equal, just `return` because this value is a duplicate. 
	4. `parent` should now be a reference to the node that will become the parent of the `new_nnode`
3. Insert the `new_node` by setting the parent's child:
	1. Set the `new_node`'s parent to the parent we just found
	2. If the parent is `None`, we are dealing with a new root, so set the tree's `root` data member to the `new_node`
	3. Otherwise, compare the values of the parent and `new_node` and set the parent's `left` or `right` child based on the results

We're done for now! We've really just made another (more complicated) regular binary tree, seeing as it's not a fully-fledged red-black tree yet... but these upgrades will allow us to implement the rest of the logic in the next few lessons, So far we've:
- We've added a `parent` pointer from child to parent (so children know who their parents are)
- We've added the mechanisms for coloring the nodes, but have defaulted them all to `red` for now. 

#### Tips
I'd highly recommend using pencil/paper or some kind of drawing tool to visualize the tree as you go through the assignments in this chapter. 

``` python
class RBNode:
	def __init__(self, val):
		self.red = False
		self.parent = None
		self.val = val
		self.left = None
		self.right = None


class RBTree:
	def __init__(self):
		self.nil = RBNode(None)
		self.nil.red = False
		self.nil.left = None
		self.nil.right = None
		self.root = self.nil

	def insert(self, val):
		new_node = RBNode(val)
		new_node.parent = None
		new_node.left = self.nil
		new_node.right = self.nil
		new_node.red = True

		# Find the parent of the new_node
		parent = None
		current = self.root

		# Traverse the tree to find the insertion point
		while current != self.nil:
			parent = current
			if new_node.val < current.val:
				current = current.left
			elif new_node.val > current.val:
				current = current.right
			else:
				return

		# insert the new_node
		new_node.parent = parent

		# Now determine if it's the root or a child of the parent
		if parent is None:
			self.root = new_node
		elif new_node.val < parent.val:
			parent.left = new_node
		else:
			parent.right = new_node
```
