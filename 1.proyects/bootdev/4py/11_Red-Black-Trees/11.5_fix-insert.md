Rotations are only useful if we can use them. When new nodes are inserted into the tree, they can break the red-black properties. We'll fix that by rotating the tree as new nodes are inserted, ensuring the tree remains balanced. 

When we're done here, we will have a fully functional (albeit insert-only) red-black tree. As you can see if you look at the bottom of the test suite, we'll be inserting numbers into our tree in order. A normal binary tree would break down into a single unruly branch:
```
                  > 7
               > 6
            > 5
         > 4
      > 3
   > 2
> 1
```
But our red-black tree will remain balanced:
```
      > 7
   > 6
      > 5
> 4
      > 3
   > 2
      > 1
```

### Assignment
In our implementation, we'll perform a "normal" insert, and then call a `fix_insert` method that will recolor and rotate the tree as necessary. This will ensure that the red-black properties are maintained. 
	1. Complete the `insert` method to call our balancing method after inserting a new node. 
	2. Complete the `fix_insert` method that maintains red-black tree properties:
		1. While the current node is not the root and has a red parent:
			1. Identify the "parent", "grandparent", and "uncle" nodes of the newly inserted node
			2. If the parent is a right child of the grandparent:
				1. If the uncle is red:
					- Recolor the uncle and parent to black
					- Recolor the grandparent to red
					- Move up the tree by making the current node the grandparent
				2. If the uncle is black;
					- If the current node is the left child of the parent:
						- Move up the tree by making the current node the parent
						- Rotate right around the current node
						- Set the parent to be the current node's parent
					- Recolor the parent to black
					- Recolor the grandparent to red
					- Rotate left around the grandparent
			3. If the parent is a left child of the grandparent:
				1. If the uncle is red:
					- Recolor the uncle and parent to black
					- Recolor the grandparent to red
					- Move up the tree by making the current node the grandparent
				2. If the uncle is black:
					- if the current node is the right child of the parent:
						- Move up the tree by making the current node the parent
						- Rotate left around the current node
						- Set the parent to be the current node's parent
					- Recolor the parent to black
					- Recolor the grandparent to red
					- Rotate right around the grandparent
		2. Recolor the root to black

			uncle = grandparent.left:
			if uncle.red:
				uncle.red = False
				parent.red = False
				grandparent.red = True
				new_node = grandparent
			else: #  uncle is black
				if new_node == parent.left:
					new_node = parent
					self.rotate_right(new_node)
				parent.red = False
				grandparent.red = True
				self.rotate_left(grandparent)
		else: # parent is a left child
			uncle = grandparent.right:
			if uncle.red:
				uncle.red = False
				parent.red = False
				grandparent.red = True
				new_node = grandparent
			else: # uncle is black
				if new_node == parent.right:
					new_node = parent
					self.rotate_left(new_node)
					parent = new_node.parent
				parent.red = False
				grandparent.red = true
				self.rotate_right(grandparent)
	self.root.red = False
