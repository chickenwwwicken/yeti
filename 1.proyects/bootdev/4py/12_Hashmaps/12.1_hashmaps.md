A hash map or ["hash table"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)  is a data structure that maps keys to values:
``` 
"bob" -> "ross"
"pablo" -> "picasso"
"leonardo" -> "davinci"
```
The lookup, insertion, and deletion operations of a hashmap have an average computational cost of O(1). Asssuming you know the key, nothing beats a hashmap! A ppython dict is an example of a hashmap. See, you already know what a hashmap is!

### Under the Hood
While hashmaps are simple to use - you're already proficient with them if you know how to use a Python dictionnary - the implementation is a bit trickier. 

Hashmaps are buyilt on  top of arrays (or in the case of ours, a Python list). They use a hash funnction to convert a "hashable" key into an index in the array. From a high-level, all that matters to is is that the hash function: 
1. Takes a key and returns an integer. 
2. Always returns the same integer for the samee key. 
3. Always returns a valid index in the array (e.g. not negative, and not greater than the array size)

Ideally the hash function hashes each key to a unique index, but most hash table designs emploiy an inperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions where the [hashfunction](https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/)  generates the same index for more than one key. An example of a collision in the above example would be "bob" and "leonardo" both hashing to index 3. I deally "leonardo" wouuld hash to some other index, like 2. 

Such collisions are typically accommodated for, and are not a problem in practice.
