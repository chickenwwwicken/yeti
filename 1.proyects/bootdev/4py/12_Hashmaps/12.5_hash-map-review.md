Hashmaps are awesome. They are simple to use and have an average computational cost of `O(1)` for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.

In Python, that means dictionaries. In Go, it means maps. In javascript, it means object literals.
The point is, if you need an in-memory key-value store, hashmaps are awesome,
and every language tends to have a built-in implementation.

### Properties of a Good Hash Map
- Fast Lookups: Hashmaps have an average time complexity of `O(1)` for lookups, insetions and deletions.
- Unordered: Hashmaps (typically) do not guarantee any particular oder of keys.
- No Ranging: While hashmaps are great for lookuups, they don't provide the ability to look into a range of keys (e.g. the largest ten keys). That's one reason production databases llike Postgres use binary trees for searching.
- Collision Resistant: Hashmaps are built on top of arrays and use a hash function to convert a key into an index. Production-ready implementations (like Python dictionaries) handle hash collisions and make them a non-issue in practice.
- Hashabllle Keys: Keys must be hashable. this means they must be immutable and have a consistent hash value. For example, in Python, a tuple can be a key, but a list cannot.
- Efficient Resizing: When a hashmap's capacity is exceeded, it dynamically resizes (usually by doubling in size) and rehashes the elements. A good hashmap manages this resizing efficiently, minimizing performance hits.
- Uniform Distribution: A good hash function ensures keys are distributed evenly accross the hashmap's underlying array, minimizing the number of collisions and optimizing llookup speed.

### Our Toy Hashmap
Our toy hashmap:
```python
def key_to_index(self, key):
    sum = 0
    for c in key:
        sum += ord(c)
    return sum % len(self.hashmap)
```
Has a few big problems, but at least it's valuable for understanding the concepts. Some of its big problems are:
- it doesn't resize when it gets too full, annd doesn't handle collisions
- its hash funnction is simplistic and doesn't distribute keys evenly

### Questions
What happens in our toy hash map if 'ab' and 'ba' are both used as keys?
- They would collide because they have the same unicode sum
Which is a major drawback of our hash map as opposed to a more robust implementation?
- it isn't ordered and doesn't support range lookups
