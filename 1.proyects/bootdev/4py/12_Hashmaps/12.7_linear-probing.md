### Linear Probing
In the previous lessons, we've built a basic hash map that can add and retrieve key-value pairs.
However, our current implementation does not handle collisions well.
In the context of LockedIn, we want to make sure that user informationn can never be lost or overwritten.

Collisions happen when two different keys have the same index after applying the `key_to_index` function.
To handle colllisions, we can use a technique called [linear probing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probinghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing).

Linear probing works by finding the next available slot after the collision index and placing the new key*value pair there.

### Assignment
Complete the `insert` and `get` methods.

##### Insert
1. Compute the `index` for the key in the hashmap with `self.key_to_index(key)`. Create a `original_index` variable and assign index to it.
2. Initialize a boolean variable `first_iteration` to `True`.
3. Begin a `while` loop that continues as long as the hashmap's slot at `index` is occupied (`not None`) and its key doesn't match the key being inserted.
    - If this is not the first iteration and the current `index` equals `original_index`, raise an exception `"hashmap is full"`. This means we've traversed the entire hashmap without finding an empty slot.
    - Increment `index` by 1 and wrap it around to the start of the hashmap if necessary (using modulo operation with hashmap's length).
    - Set `first_iteration` to `False` after the first iteration.
4. Once an empty slot or a slot with the same key is found, assign the (key,value) pair to the current index of the hashmap.

##### Get
1. Compute the index for the key in the hashmap with `self.key_to_index(key)`. Create a `original_index` variable and assign `index` to it.
2. Initialize a boolean variable `first_iteration` to `True`.
3. Begin a `while` loop that continues as long as the hashmap's slot at `index` is occupied (`not None`).
    - If the key at the current index matches the key being searched, return the value from the key-value pair in the hashmap at the current index.
    - If this is not the first iteration and the current `index` equals `original_index`, raise an exception `"sorry, key not found"`. This means we've traversed the entire hashmap without finding the key.
    - If the key does not match, increment `index` by 1 and wrap it around to the start of the hashmap if necessary (using modulo operation with hashmap's length).
    - Set `first_iteration` to `False` after the first iteration.
4. If the `while` loop completes without finding a match, raise an exception `"sorry, key not found"`.

### Boots Advice
Imagine your hashmap is like a circular array or a ring of slots. When you're searching for an empty spot or a specific key, you might reach the end of your hashmap's internal array. If you just keep incrementing the index past the end, you'd get an IndexError because there's no slot at that position.

This is where the "wrap around" comes in. Instead of stopping, you want the index to go back to 0 and continue searching from the beginning of the hashmap.

The modulo operator (%) is your trusty spell for this!

Let's say your hashmap has a length of 5.

If your index is 0, (0 + 1) % 5 gives you 1.
If your index is 3, (3 + 1) % 5 gives you 4.
If your index is 4, (4 + 1) % 5 gives you 0. This is the "wrap around"! It effectively jumps from the last index (4) back to the first index (0).
`index = (index + 1) % len(self.hashmap)`
