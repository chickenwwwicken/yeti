Tries are one of my favorite data structures, I've used them often in the past for natural language tasks. In python, a trie is easily implemented as a nested tree of dictionaries where each key is a character that maps to the next character in a word. 
For example, the words:
- hello
- help
- hi
Would be represented as:

```python
{
	"h": {
		"e": {
			"l": {
				"l": {
					"o": {
						"*": True
					}
				},
				"p": {
					"*": True
				}
			}
		},
		"i": {
			"*": True
		}
	}
}
```

*The `*` character (paired with `True` instead of  a dictionary) is used to indicate the end of a word.*

A trie is also often referred to as a prefix "tree" because it can be used to efficiently find all of  the words that start with a given prefix.

### Assignment
We're going to use a trie to add "prefix searching" to LockedIn.
For example, a user will be able to type "dev" into a job search bar and see the autocomplete suggestions "developer", "development", "devops", etc.

***Complete the `add` method.*** It takes a word as input, and should add it to the trie.
1. Keep track of your "current level" in the trie, starting at the root.
2. Loop over each character in the word-to-add:
	1. If the character is not a key in the current level, add it and create a new nested level (dictionary) for it.
	2. update your "current level" to the new nested dictionary.
3. Once you've ensured all the dictionaries exist, add the `self.end_symbol` to the dictionary of the last character in the word. This will indicate that this is a complete word and not just a prefix of another word.

### main.py

```python
class Trie:
    def add(self, word):
        pass

    # don't touch below this line

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = {}
        self.end_symbol = "*"
```

### stdout

``` bash

```
