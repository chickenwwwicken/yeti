### Prefix Matching
Tries tend to be most useful for prefix matching. 
For example, if you wanted to find all the words in a dictionary that start with a given prefix, a trie works great! 
Autocomplete, keyword search, and spellcheck are all good examples of where a trie can be useful.

Remember, a hash table is only good for exact matches, whereas a trie allows you to look up all of the words that match a given prefix. For example, given this trie:

``` python
{
	"h": {
		"e": {
			"l": {
				"l": {
					"o": {
                        "*": True
                    }
				},
				"p": {
                    "*": True
                }
			}
		},
        "a": {
			"r": {
				"d": {
					"*": True
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

We could quickly find all the words that start with "hel" and get:
- hello
- help

### Questions
1. Hash maps can be used for `_____`
	- prefix matching
2. Checking whether or not a word exists in a trie is order `O(m)` where 'm' is...
	- the length of the word
