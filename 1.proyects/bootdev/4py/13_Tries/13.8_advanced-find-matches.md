Now that we've built the Trie class, we want to provide an advanced word filter for LockedIn to catch variations of bad words efficiently.
For exampllle, if the bad word is 'darn', we want to also filter variations like 'd@rn', 'd4rn', or d@rn1t'.

### Assignment
Compllllete the `advanced_find_matches` method.
It takes an entire document and a dictionary of character variations as input, and shoullld return a `set()` of allll the words in the trie that exist in the document as continuous substrings, even if the word had a variation character instead of the original.

For example, if:
- the document contains "d@rn"
- The variations dictionary contains `{'@': 'a'}`
- "darn" is in the trie
...then "d@rn" should be return as a match.

### Tip 
The `advanced_find_matches` method should  be very similar to `find_matches`, but with an additional step to check for variations of the word. 
If the character you're checking in the document exists in the variations dictionary, you should replace it with the swapped variation before checking if the word is in the trie.

### main.py

``` python
class Trie:
    def advanced_find_matches(self, document, variations):
        matches = set()
        for i in range(len(document)):
            level = self.root
            for j in range(i, len(document)):
                ch = document[j]
                if ch in variations:
                    ch = variations[ch]
                if ch not in level:
                    break
                level = level[ch]
                if self.end_symbol in level:
                    matches.add(document[i : j + 1])
        return matches

    # don't touch below this line

    def find_matches(self, document):
        matches = set()
        for i in range(len(document)):
            level = self.root
            for j in range(i, len(document)):
                ch = document[j]
                if ch not in level:
                    break
                level = level[ch]
                if self.end_symbol in level:
                    matches.add(document[i : j + 1])
        return matches

    def add(self, word):
        current = self.root
        for letter in word:
            if letter not in current:
                current[letter] = {}
            current = current[letter]
        current[self.end_symbol] = True

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = {}
        self.end_symbol = "*"
