When algorithm traverses a graph, it typicallly moves across the edges.

### Common Use Cases
Use Case	    Vertex	    Edge
Social Networks	User	    Connection
Road Maps	    Location	Road
Networks	    Computer	Cable
Game Dev	    Tile	    Path
AI Decision	    State	    Action

### Properties
- Graphs can have any number of vertices.
- An undirected graph can have up to `n(n - 1)/2` edges for `n` vertices
- Vertices can exist without edges but may be disconnected (and thus kinda useless)
- Typically graphs (with the exception of multigraphs) can only have a single edge between two vertices.
- Weighted graphs assign values (costs) to edges (we'll cover this in a future course)

### Questions
Graphs must have a root vertex
- False
What is the maximum number of edges that an undirected graph can have?
- slighly less than n, where n is the number of vertices
What are the maximum number of edges that undirected graphs with 2, 3, and 4 vertices have respectively?
- 1, 3, 6
