Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree
or graph data sturctures. It starts at a root (some arbitrary node on a graph),
and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth before going on to the nodes at the next level.

### Stable Sorting
Non-integer sets are not "stable" in Python - the order of elements in a set is not guaranteed to be the same each time you iterate over it.

While testing, we want our algorithm to search the same way every time to make debugging easier. 
Python offers a sorted() function we can call on our `set()` that will return a sorted iterable.

``` python
sorted_items = sorted(unsorted_set)
```

### Assignment
Graphs are useful at LockedIn for more than just representing social connections!
We'll also use it to build our geographic search feature.
We have a graph of cities, where each sity is a vertex,
and each road connecting two cities is an edge.

**Complete the `breadth_first_search` method on the `Graph` class.**

This method traverses a graph level by level starting from a specified vertex,
and returns all vertices in the order they were visited.
The breadth-first approach ensures we explore all vertices at the current distance from the start before moving further away.

1. Initialize tracking structures:
    - Create a list to track visited vertices
    - create a list to use as a queue for vertices waiting to be explored
2. Begin the search:
    - Add the starting vertex to the queue
3. Process the queue until empty:
    - Remove the first vertex from the queue and add it to the visited list
    - Get a sorted list of this vertex's neighbors
    - For each neighbor:
        - If it hasn't been visited or queued yet, add it to the queue
4. When complete:
    - Return the visited list containing vertices in the order they were discovered

    We're using unique strings now as our vertices, rather than integers.

        while len(queue):
            visiting = queue[0]
            visited.append(visiting)
            queue.remove(visiting)
            sorted_neighbors = sorted(self.graph[visiting])
            for neighbor in sorted_neighbors:
                if neighbor not in queue and neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        return visited
