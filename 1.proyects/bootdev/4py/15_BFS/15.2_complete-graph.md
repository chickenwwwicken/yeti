A complete graph is a graph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

![[15.2_complete-graph]]


Vertices	Edges
2	        1
3	        3
4	        6
5	        10
...	        ...

The formula for the number fo edges in a complete graph is `n(n - 1)/2`,
where `n` is the number of vertices.

### Questions
