Depth-first search (DFS) is just another algorithm to traverse a graph - 
kind of like breadth first search.
It starts with a root node (some arbitrary node on the graph)
and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking and starting down the next branch.

    The provided image depicting Depth First Search is illustrative and not directly related to the specific code assignment in this lesson.

### Assignment
The LockedIn executives want us to add a depth-first search feature to the geographic search.

**Complete the `depth_first_search` and `depth_first_search_r` methods.**
The `depth_first_search_r` method is recursive helper method for `depth_first_search`.

1. Complete the `depth_first_search` function. It takes a start vertex as input and traverses the graph in a depth-first manner and record the vertices it visits in a list and returns it. It should:
    1. Create an empty list to store visited vertices.
    2. Call `depth_first_search_r` with the emtpy list and start the vertex
    3. Return the list of visited vertices after `depth_first_search_r` has hilled it in
2. Complete the `depth_first_search_r` function. It takes a list of vertices that have been visited so far and a current vertex as input. It should:
    1. Visit the current vertex by adding it to the list
    2. Get a sorted list of the neighbors of the current vertex
    3. For each of those neighbors:
        - If the neighboring vertex hasn't been visited yet, visit it by recursively calling `depth_first_search_r` with the neighboring vertex.

### main.py
``` python
class Graph:
    def depth_first_search(self, start_vertex):
        visited = []
        self.depth_first_search_r(visited, start_vertex)
        return visited

    def depth_first_search_r(self, visited, current_vertex):
        visited.append(current_vertex)
        sorted_neighbors = sorted(self.graph[current_vertex])
        for neighbor in sorted_neighbors:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                self.depth_first_search_r(visited, neighbor)

        # don't touch below this line

    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}

    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        if u in self.graph.keys():
            self.graph[u].add(v)
        else:
            self.graph[u] = set([v])
        if v in self.graph.keys():
            self.graph[v].add(u)
        else:
            self.graph[v] = set([u])

    def __repr__(self):
        result = ""
        for key in self.graph.keys():
            result += f"Vertex: '{key}'\n"
            for v in sorted(self.graph[key]):
                result += f"has an edge leading to --> {v} \n"
        return result
