So, should you use DFS or BFS when traversing a graph? 
Well it depends.
Let's look at some rules of thumb we can use to help make the decision.

### Is the Solution Close to the Root?
If you have a good reason to believe the vertex you're looking for is close to the root (where you plan to start searching) then BFS should be faster.

### Does the Graph Have Wide Levels?
Imagine a tree-like grpah with `10` vertices on the first level.
Each of those ten vertices point to another ten verticees.
The number of vertices at each level would be:

```
level 0: 1
level 1: 10
level 2: 100
level 3: 1000
level 4: 10000
```

Because BFS stores each horizontal level in memory at the same time,
you might run out of memory.
DFS would likely be more memory efficient.

### Is the  Search Space Infinite?
In some searches, the graph has infinite size.
For example, imagine a simluation of a game of chess.

The first level of the graph represents all the possible current moves,
the next level all the possible 2nd moves, and this goes on forever,
especially when you consider that there are possible loops within the game
(moving a queen back and forth).

In these cases, true DFS is practically impossible, you would either be forced to:
- Use BFS
- Use another algorithm
- Put a limit on ho0w far your DFS algorithm can search before returning

### Questions
Which search strategy would you prefer if the solution is likely very shallow in a tree-based graph?
- [x] bfs
- [ ] dfs
Which search strategy would you prefer in a search space of infinite depth?
- [ ] bfs
- [x] dfs
Which search strategy would use less memory in a wide graph?
- [ ] bfs
- [x] dfs
