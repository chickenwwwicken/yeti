Consider the code from the last assignnment:

```python
def prime_factors(n):
    prime_factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n /= 2
        prime_factors.append(2)
    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            n /= i
            prime_factors.append(i)
    if n > 2:
        prime_factors.append(int(n))
    return prime_factors
```

### Questions
Which  is this problem definitely a part of ?
- a
Given two large primes and a product, can we verify that the two primes multiply into the product in poly time?
- a

### Big O Analysis
Let us denote `n` as the integer input, 
and `s` as the size of `n` in bits. `s = log2(n)`

Notice that our first loop iterates `log(n)` times and the second loop iterates `sqrt(n)` times. 
The Big O with respect to `n` is `O(sqrt(n))!` That's fast! 
That's polynomial complexity which would lead us to believe the problem is in `P`

### Wait!
The problem is that, by definition, when computer scientists talk about this problem,
they are talking about the length of `n` in bits. 
What we will call `s`. For example, the integer `255` only takes `8` bits.

`241` = `11110001` in binary

Since `s = log2(n)`, a complexity of `O(sqrt(n))` is equivalent to `O(sqrt(2^s))`

The complexity in respect to the number of bits is exponential.

### Code

``` python
def prime_factors(n):
    prime_factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n /= 2
        prime_factors.append(2)
    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            n /= i
            prime_factors.append(i)
    if n > 2:
        prime_factors.append(int(n))
    return prime_factors
```
