In LockedIn, we have a list of influencers and their respective follower counts.
We want to find a subset of influencers whose total follower count is equal to a target number.

This problem is known as the Subset Sum Problem, which is an NP-hard problem. 
It asks the question, "Can we pick numbers from a list to add up to a target number?"

### Assignment
Complete the `subset_sum` function.

It should take a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`,
and return `True` if there exists a subset of `nums` that adds up to `target`,
and `False` otherwise. We'll use a recursive, brute-force approach to solve the problem.
Brute-force just means we'll try every possible combination to see if any of them add up to the target.

#### Pseudocode: `subset_sum(nums, target)`

**Inputs**
1. `nums`: A list of integers representing the follower counts of influencers.
2. `target`: The target sum we want to find a subset for.

**Output**
`True` if there exists a subset of `nums` that adds up to `target`. `False` otherwise.

**Algorithm**
1. Call the helper function starting with the last index in `nums` and return its result

### Pseudocode: `find_subset_sum(nums, target, index)`

**Inputs**
1. `nums`: A list of integers representing the follower counts of influencers.
2. `target`: The target sum we want to find a subset for.
3. `index`: The index of the current element we're considering.

**Output**
`True` if there exists a subset of `nums` that adds up to `target`. `False` otherwise.

**Algorithm**
1. If the `target` is `0`, return `True.`
2. If the index is less than `0` and the `target` is not `0`, return `False`.
3. If the number at the current index is greater than the `target`, call the helper function with the same `target` but with the index decremented by 1, and `return` the result, we're done.
4. Otherwise, call the helper function with the same `target` and index decremented by 1, and save the result.
5. Also, call the helper function with the `target` reduced by the value of the current element and the `index` decremented by 1
6. If either of these calls returns `True`, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.
