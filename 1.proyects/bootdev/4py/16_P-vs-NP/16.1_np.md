Nondeterministic polynomial time, `NP`, is the set of problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomiall time, but not necessarily solved in polynomial time.

### P Is in NP
Because all problems that can be solved in polynomial time can also be verified in polynomial time, all the problems in `P` are also `NP`.

### The Oracle
A good way of thinking about problems in `NP` is to imagine that we hace a magic oragle that gives us potential solutions to problems.
Here would be our process for finding if a problem is in `NP`:
- Present the problem to the magic oracle
- The magic oracle gives us a potential solution
- We verify in polynomial time that the solution is correct

If we can do the verification in polynomial time, the problem is in `NP`,
otherwise, it isn't.
