A famous example of a probelm in `NP` is the [Traveling Salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem),
also known as `TSP`.

The version of the problem that we will solve can be stated:

    Given a list of cities, the distances between each pair of cities, and a total distance, is there a path through all the cities that is less than the distance given?

![[16.2_traveling-salesman.png]]

For example, with the above graph, the problem could be,
"Is there a way to travel through A, B, C, and D in less than a distance of `67`?"
The answer would be "yes" by way of `A -> B -> D -> C`

### Assignment
Our influencers need to travel to conferences to shill their sponsor's products!
Since none of them trust Google Maps, they want to put in their proposed route to LockedIn,
and we will tell them if their route is short enough to be worth their time
(can you say feature creep?).

Complete the `tsp` function by performing a brute-force search using the provided algo.
The brute-force search will, unfortunately, take factorial time, `O(n!)`, 
because you will need to try all possible paths and keep track of the shortest.

The provided `permutations()` will give you alll the possible permutations of a list.
For example, `permutations([0,1,2])` returns:

``` python
[
  [0, 1, 2],
  [0, 2, 1],
  [1, 0, 2],
  [1, 2, 0],
  [2, 0, 1],
  [2, 1, 0]
]
```

#### Pseudocode
**Inputs**:
- `cities`: A list of numbers starting from `0` that each represents a city.
- `paths`: A matrix where each point represents the distance between two cities.
- `dist`: The distance we are trying to beat.

Here's an example of the `paths` matrix (a list of lists).
Each list represents the distance from that city to all the other cities.
For example, `paths[0][1]` holds the distance from city `0` to city `1`.
`paths[0][1]` = `paths[1][0]`

```python
paths = [
    [0, 12, 30], # list 0 shows the distance from city 0 to cities 0, 1 and 2
    [12, 0, 15], # list 1 shows the distance from city 1 to cities 0, 1 and 2
    [30, 15, 0], # list 2 shows the distance from city 2 to cities 0, 1 and 2
]

# all of the routes and their distances:

paths[0][1] # 12
paths[0][2] # 30
paths[1][2] # 15

# the shortest distance between all cities is from city 0 to city 1 to city 2, which is 27
```

#### Algorithm:
1. Use the `permutations` function to get the matrix of all possible paths through the given `cities`. Where the first path, `[0, 1, 2]` represents moving from `city 0 -> city 1 -> city 2`
2. iterate over each possible path (permutation)
    1. Sum the distances between each city in the path using the `paths` matrix to look up the distances
    2. If the total distance of the path is less than the given `dist` return `True`
3. If no short paths were found, return `False`

### main.py

``` python
def tsp(cities, paths, dist):
    matrix = permutations(cities)
    for permutation in matrix:
        sum = 0
        for i in range(0, len(permutations) - 1):
            sum += paths[permutations[i]][permutations[i+1]]
        # add this line if tsp is to go back to the first city
        # sum += paths[permutations[-1]][permutations[0]]
        if sum < dist:
            return True
    return False


# don't touch below this line


def permutations(arr):
    res = []
    res = helper(res, arr, len(arr))
    return res


def helper(res, arr, n):
    if n == 1:
        tmp = arr.copy()
        res.append(tmp)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            res = helper(res, arr, n - 1)
            if n % 2 == 1:
                arr[n - 1], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[n - 1]
            else:
                arr[0], arr[n - 1] = arr[n - 1], arr[0]
    return res
```
