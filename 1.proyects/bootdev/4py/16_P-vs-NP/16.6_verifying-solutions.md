Let's circle back to this idea of "slow to solve, fast to verify".

Even when we aren't specifically talking about P and NP, the concept of 
"slow to solve, fast to verify" is very important in real-world software.
As a trivial example, imagine the password on an email account.
When a user inputs a password like:
`p@ssword4Mi`

It's easy to verify if that password matches the one we have saved on file.
It's literally as easy as:

``` python
should_grant_access = user_input == saved_password
```

This useful bit is that it takes much longer to guess the correct password.

    This password example demonstrates the guess/verify concept well, but when it comes to storing passwords in plain text this example is very insecure. We'll cover how to handle passwords in a production system in a future course.

### Assignment
The influencers who use LockedIn are worried about account security.
We've assured them that their passwords are long and strong enough, but they want data

**Complete the `get_num_guesses` function.**

It takes a passwords length as input and returns the number of guesses required to ensure that a password of that length or shorter is guessed.
Assume a brute-force guessing strategy on the part of an attacker.
A guesser needs to guess all possible passwords up to and including the given length.
For example:

```
a
b
c
...
aa
ab
ac
...
ba
bb
bc
...
aaa
aab
aac
...
```

Assume that only the 26 lowercase English letters can be used in passwords.
Here's some example input/output:

Input   Output
1       26
2       702
3       18278

### main.py

```python
# chicken solution
def get_num_guesses(length):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, length + 1):
        total += 26**i
    return total

# boots solution
def get_num_guesses(length):
    return sum(26**i for i in range(1, length + 1))
```
