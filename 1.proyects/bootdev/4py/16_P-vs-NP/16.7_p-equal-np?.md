The `P` versus `NP` problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science.
It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (is in `NP`)
can also be solved quickly (is in `P`).

The question is, "Are all `NP` problems really just `P` problems?"

the answer is, "we don't know, probably not".

### Why do we Care?
All problems in NP (you know, hard ones like the traveling salesman problem)
have been proven to also be solvable in poly time if we can find a solution to just one `NP-complete` problem.

If a single `NP-complete` problem can be solved quickly (in poly time) that means tha tal problems in NP can be solved in poly time. 
That would be a huge deal, particularly because it would break digital security systems that rely on the difficulty of certain `NP` problems.

### Questions
What happens if we find a poly time solution to an NP-complete problem?
- [ ] we learn nothing
- [x] P = NP
- [ ] P != NP
Does P = NP?
- [ ] yes
- [x] we don't know, but probably not
- [ ] no
- [ ] it's impossible to know
