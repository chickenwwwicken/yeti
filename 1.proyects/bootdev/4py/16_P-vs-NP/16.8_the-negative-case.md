We do not know for sure if P equals NP because we can't find any poly time solutions
to NP-complete problems.
Additionally, we have been unable to prove whether P does not equal NP.
We suspect P does not equal NP because it has been so difficult to prove that P=NP.

That said, it's actually more complicated to prove the negative case.
To prove the positive case, that P=NP, we simply need to solve an NP-complete
problem like TSP in poly time.
In order to prove the negative case, that `P != NP`, we would need to exhaustively prove that there's no possible way to solve TSP in polynomial time.
That's a lot trickier.
