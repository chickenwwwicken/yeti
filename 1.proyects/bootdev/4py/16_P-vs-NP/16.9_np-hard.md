All NP-complete problems are [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness),
but not all NP-hard problems are NP-complete.
The determining factor between NP-complete and NP-hard is that not all NP-hard prblems are NP.

### Definition
    A problem is NP-hard if every problem in NP can be reduced into it in poly time.

Compare this to the slightly different definition of NP-complete:

    A problem is NP-complete if it is in NP and every other problem in NP can be reduced into it in poly time

the difference is that NP-complete problems must be in NP,
or in other words, they must be verifiable in poly time.
NP-hard has no such restriction.
