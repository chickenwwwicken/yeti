In the context of computer sciennce, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions. In short, an algorithm is: 

- Defined: there is a specific sequence of steps that performs a task
- Unambiguous: there is a "correct" and "incorrect" interpretation of the steps. 
- Implementable: it can be executed using software and hardware

Algorithms are usually written in "pseudocode" because an algorithm is a higher-level description of a solution to a problem. An algorithm doesn't care if it's implemented in Python, Go, TS, or Java. Pseudocode is just palin English that describes the steps of the algorithm . 

Here's some pseudocode for a mystery algorithhm: 

1. Start with an original string called `S` and a new empty string called `R`. 
2. Loop through `S` from its last character to its first character, and for each one, add it to the end of `R`. 
3. Once you've processed all the characters, return `R`.
