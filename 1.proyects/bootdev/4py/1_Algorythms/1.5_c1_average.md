### Average
We now need a way to show our LockedIn  influencers the average follower count of the people they follow. This will help them know if they're following people who are more or less popular than them. 

### Assignment
Complete the `average_followers` function. It should return the average of the given list of numbers. 

``` python
def average_followers(nums):
	sum = 0
	if not nums: 
		return None
	for num in nums:
		sum += num
	avg = sum/len(nums)
	return avg	
```
