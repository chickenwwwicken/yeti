An exponent indicates how many times a number is to be multiplied by itself. 

For example:
5'3 = `5 * 5 * 5` = `125`

Sometimes exponents are also written using the caret symbol "^"

### Exponent Syntax
The `**` operator calculates an exponent in Python

``` python
square = 2 ** 2 
# square = 4

cube = 2 ** 3
# cube = 8
```

### Assignment
In the social media industry,m there is a concept called "spread": how much a post spreads due to "reshares" after all of the original author's followers see it. As it turns  out, social media posts spread at an exponential rate! We've found that the estimated spread of a post can be calculated with this formula:

``` python
estimated_spread = average_audience_followers * ( num_followers ^ 1.2 )
```
In the formula above, `average_audience_followers` is an average calculated from each number within the `audiences_followers` argument - which is a list containing the individual follower counts of the author's  followers. For example, if `audiences_followers = [2, 3, 2, 19]`, then: 
- the author has `4` total followers
- each follower has their own `2`, `3`, `2`, `19` followers, respectively. 
Complete the `get_estimated_spread` function by implementing the formula above. The only input is `audiences_followers`, which is a list of the follower counts of all the followers the author has. Return the estimated spread. If the `audiences_followers` list is empty, return 0. 

``` python
def get_estimated_spread(audiences_followers):
	if not audiences_followers:
		return 0
	sum = 0 
	for follow in audiences_followers:
		sum += follow
	avg = sum / len(audiences_followers)
	return (len(audiences_followers) ** 1.2) * avg
```
