Exponents are really simple once you get the hang of them:

| Exponent | Expanded Form   | Result |
| -------- | --------------- | ------ |
| 22       | `2 * 2`         | 4      |
| 23       | `2 * 2 * 2`     | 8      |
| 32       | `3 * 3`         | 9      |
| 33       | `3 * 3 * 3`     | 27     |
| 42       | `4 * 4`         | 16     |
| 43       | `4 * 4 * 4`     | 64     |
| 44       | `4 * 4 * 4 * 4` | 256    |

Sometimes exponents are also written using the caret symbol (`^`):

`5^3` = 53

And to just give you a bit of vocabulary:

- 53 is read as "5 to the power of 3"
- 5 is the "base"
- 3 is the "exponent"
