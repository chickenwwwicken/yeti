A logarithm is the _inverse of an exponent_.

24 = 16

log2(16) = 4

"log2(16)" can be read as "log base 2 of 16", and means "the number of times 2 must be multiplied by itself to equal 16".

"log2(16)" might also be written as `log2(16)`

Some more examples:

|Logarithm|Result|
|---|---|
|log22|1|
|log24|2|
|log28|3|
|log216|4|
|log1010|1|
|log10100|2|
|log101000|3|
|log1010000|4|

## Python Syntax

There isn't a language-level operator to calculate a logarithm, but we can [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html) the [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) library and use the [`math.log()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.log) function.

``` python
import math

print(f"Logarithm base 2 of 16 is: {math.log(16, 2)}")
# Logarithm base 2 of 16 is: 4.0
```

## Assignment

Let's create an "influencer score". It will be a small number (like less than `100`) that will give influencers a metric for comparing their social media success against their peers.

Complete the `get_influencer_score` function. An influencer score is their average engagement percentage multiplied by log base 2 of their follower count.

``` python
import math


def get_influencer_score(num_followers, average_engagement_percentage):
    return average_engagement_percentage * math.log(num_followers, 2)
```
