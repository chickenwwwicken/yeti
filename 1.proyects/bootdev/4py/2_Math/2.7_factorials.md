We're almost done with the math that you'll need for this course! 

The factorial of a positive integer `n`, written `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than and equal to `n`. 

`5!` = `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1` = `120`

The results of a factorial grow even faster than exponentiation! 

`n!` grows faster than `2^n` :


| |n!|2^n|
|---|---|---|
|2|2|4|
|3|6|8|
|4|24|16|
|5|120|32|
|6|720|64|

### Assignment

Influencers need to be able to schedule posts to be published in the future. We've found that the order in which the posts are published drastically affects their performance.

**Complete the `num_possible_orders` function**. It takes the number of posts an influencer has in their backlog as input and returns the total number of possible orders in which we could publish the posts.

Factorials are useful whenever you're trying to count how many ways a collection caan be ordered. For example, how many different ways can a deck of cards be arranged? 

- The first card could be any of the 52 cards.
- The second card can be any of the 51 cards. 
- The third card can be any of the 50 remaining cards...

That means the total number of possibilities is the 52 options multiplied by 51 options multiplied by 50 options, and so on. 

Or in otheer words the number of possible combinations for a deck of cards is `52!`, or `80.658.175.170.943.878.571.660.636.856.403.766.975.289.505.440.883.277.824.000.000.000.000` 

``` python
def num_possible_orders(num_posts):
    total = 1
    num = num_posts
    if num_posts < 2:
        return total
    while num > 1:
        total = total * num
        num -= 1
    return total

# Recursive version
def num_possible_orders_rec(num_posts):
    if num_posts < 2:
        return 1 
    return num_posts * num_possible_orders_rec(num_posts - 1)
```
