`O(nm)` is _very_ similar to `O(n^2)`, but instead of a single input that we care about, there are two. If `n` and `m` increase at the same rate, then `O(nm)` is effectively the same as `O(n^2)`. However, if `n` or `m` increases faster or slower, then it's useful to track their complexity separately.

## Assignment

LockedIn needs a new tool that allows big brands to see how many of an influencer's followers are loyal to their brand. Complete the `get_avg_brand_followers` function. It takes two inputs:

- `all_handles`: a 2-dimensional list, or "list of lists" of strings representing user handles on a per-influencer basis.
- `brand_name`: a string.

`get_avg_brand_followers` returns the [average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) number of handles that contain the `brand_name` across all the lists. Each list represents the audience of a single influencer.

### Example Input/Output

Input:

```py
all_handles = [
    ["cosmofan1010", "cosmogirl", "billjane321"],
    ["cosmokiller", "gr8", "cosmojane3"],
    ["iloveboots", "paperthin"]
]
brand_name = "cosmo"
```

Expected output: 1.33 (handles per influencer, because 4 handles contained "cosmo" and there are 3 lists)

## Observe

Regarding Big O, the number of influencers (the number of lists) matters. That's our `n`. However, the average number of followers of each influencer (the average length of the lists) is just as important. That's our `m`.

``` python
def get_avg_brand_followers(all_handles, brand_name):
    # n = number of inffluencers (number of lists)
    # m = average length of lists
    ncount = 0
    brand_handles = 0
    for handles in all_handles:
        ncount += 1
        for handle in handles:
            if brand_name in handle:
                brand_handles += 1
    return brand_handles/ncount
```
