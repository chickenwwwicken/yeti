Consider the following instructions:
``` python
def sum(nums):
	total = 0
	for num in nums:
		total += num
	return total
```
``` python
def double_sum(nums):
	total = 0
	for num in nums:
		double = num + num
		total += double
	return total
```
### Questions
- What is the Big O of `sum()` and `double_sum()` respectively - O(n) O(n)
- Ignoring Big O theory, which function will realistically take longer to execute? - double_sum
