`O(1)` means that no matter the size of the input, there is no growth in the runtime of the algorithm. This is also referred to as a "constant time" algorithm.

In Python, a [`dictionary`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) offers the ability to look items up by key, which is an operation that is independent of the size of the dictionary:

```py
# this is a constant time lookup
org = organizations[org_id]
```

Dictionary lookups are `O(1)`. _Which is one of the reasons dictionaries and dictionary-equivalents in other languages are used all over the place_.

## Assignment

We need to be able to search our LockedIn user base more quickly! Our users are complaining that the search bar is painfully slow. You'll notice that if you run the code in its current state, it will take a _very long time_.

The `find_last_name` function takes

- `names_dict`: a dictionary of `first_name -> last_name`.
- `first_name`: a string.

If `first_name` is a key in the dictionary, `find_last_name` returns the associated last name. If the [key is not found](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyError), it returns `None`.

Write the function so that it runs quickly! It should be `O(1)`.

``` python
def find_last_name(names_dict, first_name):
	return names_dict.get(first_name)
```
