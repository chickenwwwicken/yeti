Another sorting algorithm we never covered in-depth is called "selection sort". It's similar to bubble sort in that it works by repeatedly swapping items in a list. However, it's slightly more efficient than bubble sort because it only makes one swap per iteration. 

Selection sort pseudocode:
- for each index:
	- Set `smallest_idx` to the current index
	- for each index from `smallest_idx+1` to the end of the list:
		- If the number at the inner index is smaller than the number at `smallest_idx`, set `smallest_idx` to the inner index
	- swap the nnumber at the current index with the number at `smallest_idx`

### Assignment
Complete the `selection_sort` function. 

It should sort the input list `nums` in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm. The function should then `return` the sorted list. 

``` python
def selection_sort(nums):
	# Iterate through each position in the list
    for i in range(0, len(nums)):
	    # Assume the current position contains the smallest element
        smallest_idx = i

		# Look through the rest of the list to find a smaller element
        for j in range(smallest_idx+1, len(nums)):
	        # If we find a smaller element, update smallest_idx
			if nums[j] < nums[smallest_idx]:
                smallest_idx = j

        # Swap the smallest element into the current position
        nums[i], nums[smallest_idx] = nums[smallest_idx], nums[i]

	# Return the sorted list
    return nums
```
