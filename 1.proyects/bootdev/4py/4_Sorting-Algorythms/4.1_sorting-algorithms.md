Almost every action you take in a web app relies on sorted data. Just looking up a user's profile in a database likely relies on a sorted index.

Fortunately, most programming languages provide their own standard sorting implementation. In Python, for example, we can use the sorted function:
``` python
items = [1, 3, 5]
print(sorted(items)) # [1, 3, 5]
```
### Assignment
We need to sort influencers by vanity. Complete the `vanity` and `vanity_sort` functions. 

The `vanity` function accepts an instance of an `Influencer` and returns their vanity score. The vanity score should be the number of links in their bio multiplied by 5, plus their number of selfies. (Links in bio are weighted more heavily)

The `vanity_sort` function should return a list of influencers, ordered by their vanity from least to greatest. You can pass a function as a named parameter called `key` to sorted to control the metric the sorting algorithm will use for comparisons. 

``` python
# initial code
class Influencer:
    def __init__(self, num_selfies, num_bio_links):
        self.num_selfies = num_selfies
        self.num_bio_links = num_bio_links

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"({self.num_selfies}, {self.num_bio_links})"


# dont touch above this line


def vanity(influencer):
    # ?


def vanity_sort(influencers):
    # ?
``` 

``` python
# finished code
class Influencer:
    def __init__(self, num_selfies, num_bio_links):
        self.num_selfies = num_selfies
        self.num_bio_links = num_bio_links

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"({self.num_selfies}, {self.num_bio_links})"


# dont touch above this line

def vanity(influencer):
    return influencer.num_bio_links * 5 + influencer.num_selfies


def vanity_sort(influencers):
    return sorted(influencers, key=vanity)
```
