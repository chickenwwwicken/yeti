Wait, if the standard `sorted()` function exists, why should we learn to write a sorting algorithm from scratch?

In all seriousness, in this chapter we'll be building some of the most famous sorting algorithms from scratch because:

- It's good to understand how they work under the hood
- It's great algorithmic thinking practice
- It's fun! (at least for me)

[Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) is a very basic sorting algorithm named for the way elements "bubble up" to the top of the list.

Bubble sort repeatedly steps through a slice and compares adjacent elements, swapping them if they are out of order. It continues to loop over the slice until the whole list is completely sorted. Here's the pseudocode:

1. Set `swapping` to `True`
2. Set `end` to the length of the input list
3. While `swapping` is `True`:
    1. Set `swapping` to `False`
    2. For `i` from the 2nd element to `end`:
        - If the `(i-1)`th element of the input list is greater than the `i`th element:
            1. Swap the `(i-1)`th element and the `i`th element
            2. Set `swapping` to `True`
    3. Decrement `end` by one
4. Return the sorted list

## Assignment

While our avocado toast influencers were happy with our search functionality, now they want to be able to sort _all_ their followers by follower count. Bubble sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that we can implement quickly, so let's do that!

Complete the `bubble_sort` function according to the described algorithm above.

``` python
def bubble_sort(nums):
    swapping = True
    end = len(nums)

    while swapping == True:
        swapping = False
        for i in range(1, end):
            if nums[i-1] > nums[i]:
                temp = nums[i-1]
                nums[i-1] = nums[i]
                nums[i] = temp
                swapping = True
        end -= 1
    return nums
```
