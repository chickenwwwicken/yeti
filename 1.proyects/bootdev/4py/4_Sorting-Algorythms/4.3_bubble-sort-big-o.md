Implementation reference:

```python
def bubble_sort(nums):
    swapping = True
    end = len(nums)
    while swapping:
        swapping = False
        for i in range(1, end):
            if nums[i - 1] > nums[i]:
                temp = nums[i - 1]
                nums[i - 1] = nums[i]
                nums[i] = temp
                swapping = True
        end -= 1
    return nums
```

## Best and Worst Case

Sometimes it's useful to know how the algorithm will perform based on _what the input data is_ instead of just how much data there is. In the case of bubble sort (and many other algorithms), the best and worst case scenarios can actually change the time complexity.

- Best case: If the data is pre-sorted, bubble sort becomes really fast. Can you see why?
- Worst case: If the data is in reverse order, bubble sort becomes really slow (but still in the same complexity class as random data). Can you see why?

### Questions

#### why bubble sort?
Bubble sort is famous for how easy it is to write and understand. 

However, it's one of the slowest sorting algorithms, and as a result is almost never used in practice. That said, we covered it because it's a useful thought exercise so that you can appreciate why the more complex and performant algorithms are better. Let's cover those next. 

- What is a good reason to use bubble sort? - Because we studyin algos.
