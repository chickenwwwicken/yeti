Merge sort implementation reference:
``` python
def merge_sort(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return nums
    first = merge_sort(nums[: len(nums) // 2])
    second = merge_sort(nums[len(nums) // 2 :])
    return merge(first, second)


def merge(first, second):
    final = []
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < len(first) and j < len(second):
        if first[i] <= second[j]:
            final.append(first[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            final.append(second[j])
            j += 1
    while i < len(first):
        final.append(first[i])
        i += 1
    while j < len(second):
        final.append(second[j])
        j += 1
    return final
```

### Questions
- What is merge sort's big O complexity? - O(n log n)

## Why merge Sort?
Pros:

- **Fast**: Merge sort is much faster than bubble sort. `O(n*log(n))` instead of `O(n^2)`.
- **Stable**: Merge sort is a [stable sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stable_sorts) which means that values with duplicate keys in the original list will be in the same order in the sorted list.

Cons:

- **Memory usage**: Most sorting algorithms can be performed using a single copy of the original array. Merge sort requires extra subarrays in memory.
- **Recursive**: Merge sort requires many recursive function calls, and in many languages (like Python), this can incur a performance penalty.

### Questions
- When might merge sort be a good idea? - need a fast sorting algo and memory isn't an issue.
- Which function is recursive? - merge_sort
