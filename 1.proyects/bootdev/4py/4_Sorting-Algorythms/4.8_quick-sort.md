Quick sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that's widely used in production sorting implementations. Like merge sort, quick sort is a recursive divide and conquer algorithm. 

**Divide**:

- Select a pivot element that will _preferably_ end up close to the center of the sorted pack
- Move everything onto the "greater than" or "less than" side of the pivot
- The pivot is now in its final position
- Recursively repeat the operation on both sides of the pivot

**Conquer**:

- The array is sorted after all elements have been through the pivot operation

### Pseudocode

- Select a "pivot" element - We'll arbitrarily choose the last element in the list
- Move through all the elements in the list and swap them around until all the numbers less than the pivot are on the left, and the numbers greater than the pivot are on the right
- Move the pivot between the two sections where it belongs
- Recursively repeat for both sections

### Assignment

We now have two sorting algorithms on our LockedIn backend! It is a bit annoying to maintain both in the codebase. Quicksort is fast on large datasets just like merge sort, but is also lighter on memory usage. Let's use quick sort for both follower count and influencer revenue sorting!

Complete the `quick_sort` and `partition` functions according to the given algorithms.

The process is started with `quick_sort(A, 0, len(A)-1)`.

`quick_sort(nums, low, high)`:

1. If `low` is less than `high`:
    1. Partition the input list using the `partition` function and store the returned "middle" index
    2. Recursively call `quick_sort` on the left side of the partition
    3. Recursively call `quick_sort` on the right side of the partition

`partition(nums, low, high)`:

1. Set `pivot` to the element at index `high`
2. Set `i` to the index _below_ `low`
3. For each index (`j`) from `low` to `high`:
    1. If the element at index `j` is less than the `pivot`:
        1. Increment `i` by `1`
        2. Swap the element at index `i` with the element at index `j`
4. Swap the element to the right of `i` with the pivot element
5. Return the new index of the pivot element (the item in the "middle" of the partition)

``` python
def quick_sort(nums, low, high):
    # Base case: only proceed if there are at least 2 elements to sort
    if low < high:
        # Partition the array and get the position of the pivot
        pivot_pos = partition(nums, low, high)
        # Rcursively sort the left sub-array (elements less than pivot)
        quick_sort(nums, low, pivot_pos -1)
        # recursively sort the right sub-array (elements greater than pivot)
        quick_sort(nums, pivot_pos + 1, high)
        

def partition(nums, low, high):
    # chosing the rightmost element as the pivot
    pivot = nums[high] 
    # initialize the index of the smaller element
    # 'i' will track the boundary between elements < pivot and >= pivot
    i = low - 1
    # iterate through all elements in the current partition
    for j in range(low, high):
        # if the current element is less than the pivot
        if nums[j] < pivot:
            # move the boundary of smaller elements forward
            i += 1
            # swap the current element with the element at the boundary
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
    # Place the pivot element in its correct position
    # right after all elements less than it
    nums[i+1], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[i+1]
    # return the index where the pivot now resides
    # this becomes the dividing point for the next recursive calls
    return i + 1

```
