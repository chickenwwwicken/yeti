Broadly speaking, algorithms can be classified into two categories:

- "Polynomial time"
- "Exponential time"

_Technically `O(n!)` is "factorial" time, but let's lump them together for simplicity_

An algorithm runs in "Polynomial time" if its runtime does _not_ grow faster than `n^k`, where `k` is any constant (e.g. `n^2`, `n^3`, etc) and `n` is the size of the input.

To put it simply, polynomial time algorithms _can_ be useful, but exponential time algorithms are almost always too slow to be practical (unless you're _trying_ to force someone to be slow, like in the case of cryptography and security). Even when `n` is as low as `20`, `2^n` is already over a million!
