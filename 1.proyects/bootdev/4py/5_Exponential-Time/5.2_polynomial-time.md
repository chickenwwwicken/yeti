Back in the 1970s, some computer scientists wanted to come up with a good, descriptive name for the set of polynomial time algorithms. After much deliberation, they settled on the letter `P` ([naming things is hard](https://xkcd.com/910/)).

The hand-wavy takeaway is that:

- Problems that fall into class `P` are _practical_ to solve on computers.
- Problems that **don't** fall into `P` are hard, slow, and _impractical_.

### Questions
- Algorithms in P are `_____` than algorithms not in P 
	- more practical to solve with computers.
