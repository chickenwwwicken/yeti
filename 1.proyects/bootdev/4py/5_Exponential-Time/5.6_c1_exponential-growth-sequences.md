At LockedIn, we are interested in simulating the exponential growth of an influencer's followers over a certain period with an adjustable growth factor. 

### Assignment
Complete the `exponential_growth` function. Given the initial followers count `n`, growth factor `factor`, and number of `days`, return a list containing the exponential growth of followers for each day. 

For example:
``` 
- Initial followers: 10
- Growth factor: 2
- Days: 4

Growth sequence: [10, 20, 40, 80, 160]
```
``` python
def exponential_growth(n, factor, days):
	sequence = [n]
	for i in range(days):
		sequence.append(sequence[-1] * factor)
	return sequence
```
