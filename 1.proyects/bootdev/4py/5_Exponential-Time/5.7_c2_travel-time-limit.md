LockedIn is planning a campaign where influencers are given a time limit to visit as many countries as possible. However, the travel time between countries follows an exponential growth pattern. This means that the more countries influencers visit, the longer it takes to travel to the next one. It's a small growth factor (<2) but it's still exponential. 

It's a bit strange, we figure it's because they take more and more time lollygagging in each country for pleasure. 

### Assignment
Write a function `num_countries_in_days` that takes a maximum number of days `max_days` and a time increase factor `factor`, then returns the number of countries an influencer can visit within that time limit. 

Influencers start by spending `1` day in the first country. For the next visit and every visit after, the time in the current country is multiplied by the `factor` to determine the time required for the next country. Incomplete visits are not allowed and the cumulative time traveling cannot exceed the `max_days`. 

For example:
```
- Max days: 2
- Time factor: 1.2
Countries visited: 1
=====================================
- Max days: 3
- Time factor: 1.2
Countries visited: 2
```
``` python
def num_countries_in_days(max_days, factor):
    time_left = max_days
    count = 0
    time_in_country = 1
    if max_days < 1:
        return count
    while time_left >= time_in_country:
        time_left -= time_in_country
        count += 1 
        time_in_country *= factor
    return count
```
