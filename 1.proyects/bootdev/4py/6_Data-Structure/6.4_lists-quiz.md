Answer the questions based on this code from the last assignment:
``` python
def last_work_experience(work_experiences):
    if len(work_experiences) > 0:
        return work_experiences[len(work_experiences) - 1]
    return None
```
Lookin up an item in a list by index is much faster than searching for items using iteration. `O(1)` vs `O(n)`. 

#### Questions
- What is the Big-O complexity of the `last_work_experience()` function, where n is the length of the `work_experience` array?
	- 1
- Why is index-lookup so much faster than an iteration? 
	- the computer can jump straight to the location of an index - an index is like an address of an item in a list
