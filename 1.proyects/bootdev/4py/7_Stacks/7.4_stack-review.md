- All supported operations are `O(1)` by themselves. However, some tasks, like getting to an item at the bottom of the stack have a higher time complexity because they require multiple `pop` operations. 
- Stack operation are limited: no searching, no sorting, no random access
- Stacks, like all abstract data types, can store items of any type. What makes it a stack is the behavior of the operations, not the type of data it stores.
- Stacks are often used in the real world for:
	- Function call management
	- Undo/redo functionality
	- Expression evaluation
	- Browser history

#### Questions 
- What can be stored in a stack?
	- any of these
- If you want to get to an item at the bottom of a stack, what is the Big-O to retrieve that item
	- O(n), because all other items need to be popped first
