In LockedIn, users that are founding companies can join a matchmaking queue to find potenntial co-founders for their projects. We'll use the `Queue` class we've built to manage the matchmaking process. 

Notice the `search_and_remove` method on the `Queue` class (in `queue.py`). It breaks the rules of a traditional queue data structure but will be useful in solving this real-world problem . 

It's okay to violate academic constraints as software enginners as long as we understand the trade-offs involved. 

### Assignment
Complete the `matchmake` function that simulates users joining and leaving the matchmaking queue. The function should take a `queue` instance and a `user` tuple containing a name and action (either "join" or "leave"):
``` python
user = ('Bob', 'join')
user = ('Alice', 'leave')
```
For each call to `matchmake`:
1. If the action is "leave", search the queue for the user and remove them if they are in the queue. 
2. If the action is "join", push the user's name onto the queue. 
3. Lastly, check if the queue has at least 4 users in it. If so, pop the first 2 users from the queue and return the following string:
`"{user1} matched {user2}!"`

Where `user1` is the first user popped and `user2` is the second user popped. 

If there were less than 4 users in the queue, return the following string: `"No match found"`

``` python
from queue import Queue


def matchmake(queue, user):
    if "leave" == user[1]:
        queue.search_and_remove(user[0])
    if "join" == user[1]:
        queue.push(user[0])
    if queue.size() > 3:
        user1 = queue.pop()
        user2 = queue.pop()
        return f"{user1} matched {user2}!"
    return "No match found"
```
