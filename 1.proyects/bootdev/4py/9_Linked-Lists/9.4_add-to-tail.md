Time to allow our `LinkedList` to add new nodes to the end of the list. Kind of like a regular Python List's `.append` method. 
![[add-to-tail.png]]
### Assignment
Complete the `add_to_tail` method. It adds a new node to the end of the list and returns nothing. 
1. If there isn't a head node, set the new node as the `head` and be done.
2. Otherwise, keep a referennce to the "last" node in the list - start with it set to `None`. 
3. Iterate over the linked list (we  built this already!)
	1. update your "last" node reference to the current node
4. Once you've iterated over the entire list, your "last" reference should be the last node in the list (the "tail"). Te the `next` field of the "last" node to the new node. 

#### Observe
When you write:
``` python
for current_node in self:
	# do something
```
Python automatically does something like this:
1. It calls `self.__iter__()` to get an iterator object
2. repeatedly calls `next()` on that iterator to get each value
3. It assigns each value to `current_node` in each iteration of the loop
You don't need to explicitly call `__iter__()` yourself - Python handles that when you use the object in a `for` loop context.
``` python
# starting code
from node import Node


class LinkedList:
    def add_to_tail(self, node):
        pass

    # don't touch below this line

    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def __iter__(self):
        node = self.head
        while node is not None:
            yield node
            node = node.next

    def __repr__(self):
        nodes = []
        for node in self:
            nodes.append(node.val)
        return " -> ".join(nodes)
```
``` python
# add_to_tail func
def add_to_tail(self, node):
	if not self.head:
		self.head = node
	else:
		last_node = None
		for current_node in self:
			last_node = current_node
		last_node.next = node
```
