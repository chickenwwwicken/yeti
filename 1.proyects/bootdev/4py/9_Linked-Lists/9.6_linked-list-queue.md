To use our Linked List as a fast queue (`O(1)` pushes and pops) we need out `add_to_tail` function to be `O(1)`. Currently, it iterates over the entire list before appending an item. We can fix this by keeping track of the last item with a new data member: `tail`. 

*Note: It's common in algorithms to make this kind of trade-off. By using a little extra memory (keeping track of `tail`), we can make our operations faster. Sometimes you might need to go the other way, and use more computation time to save memory.*

### Assignment
LockedIn's queue was working just fine on small datasets, but appending ites once the list has 100,000+ items has started to take a toll on our seervers. **Implement thesee changes to speed up our Linked List's inserts** to `O(1)`:
1. `add_to_head` should set the `tail` reference to the given node if the list is empty. 
2. `add_to_tail` should:
	1. set the head and tial to the given node if the list is empty
	2. Insteead of iterating to find the last node, use the `tail` reference to append the new node
3. The constructor should set self.tail to `None`. 

``` python
# main.py
from node import Node


class LinkedList:
    def add_to_head(self, node):
        if self.head is None:
            self.tail = node
        node.set_next(self.head)
        self.head = node

    def add_to_tail(self, node):
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = node
            self.tail = node
            return
        self.tail.set_next(node)
        self.tail = node

    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    # don't touch below this line

    def __iter__(self):
        node = self.head
        while node is not None:
            yield node
            node = node.next

    def __repr__(self):
        nodes = []
        for node in self:
            nodes.append(node.val)
        return " -> ".join(nodes)
```
``` python
# node.py
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None

    def set_next(self, node):
        self.next = node

    def __repr__(self):
        return self.val
```
