We're onee method away from having a fully functioning `O(1)` Queue! We just need a way to remove the ffirst element from the linked list in constannt time. When we're finished, our `LinkedList` will fulfill the basic requirements of a Queue:
- `add_to_tail`: Constant time insert
- `remove_from_head`: Constant time pop

Let's rename the `LinkedList` class to `LLQueue` and remove the `add_to_head` functionality because Queues don't allow inserting into the wrong end. 

*We've also flipped the arrows in the printed representation to relflect the change.*

### Assignment
**Complete the `remove_from_head` method**. It should remove the first node from the list (the head) and return it. 
- If the list is empty, just return `None`. 
- The head should now point to the next nodee in the list (if there is one). 
- The tail should be `None` if the list is now empty
- The old head's Node should no longer point to anything. 

#### Tips
1. If there isn't a `head` node, return `None`. 
2. Set a `temp` reference to the current head node. 
3. Update the head reference to the nnext node in the list. 
4. If the new head reference is `None`, set the `tail` reference to `None`
5. Set the next node of the `temp` reference to `None`. 
6. Return the node stored in the `temp` reference. 

``` python
# main.py
from node import Node


class LLQueue:
	# added code
    def remove_from_head(self):
        # If the list is empty, return None
        if self.head is None:
            return None
        # Store the current head in a temporary variable
        temp = self.head
        # Move the head reference to the next node
        self.head = self.head.next
        # If the list is now empty, make sure the tail is also None
        if self.head is None:
            self.tail = None
        # Disconnect the old head from the list
        temp.next = None
        # Return the removed code
        return temp

    # don't touch below this line

    def add_to_tail(self, node):
        if self.head is None:
	        # If the queue is empty, both head and tail point to the same first node
            self.head = node
            self.tail = node
            return
        # Link current tail's 'next' to the new node
        self.tail.set_next(node)
        # Update the tail to be the new node
        self.tail = node

    def __init__(self):
        self.tail = None
        self.head = None

    def __iter__(self):
        node = self.head
        while node is not None:
            yield node
            node = node.next

    def __repr__(self):
        nodes = []
        for node in self:
            nodes.append(node.val)
        return " <- ".join(nodes)
```
