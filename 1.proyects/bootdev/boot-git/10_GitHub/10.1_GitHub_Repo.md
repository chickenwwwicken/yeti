GitHub is the most popular website for Git repos online.
That is, for hosting "remotes" on a central website. 
GitHub serves several purposes:

-  As a backup of all your code on the cloud in case something happens to your computer
- As a central place to share your code and collaborate on it with others
- As a public portfolio for your coding projects

#### Git != GitHub
It's important to understand that Git and GitHub are not the same!
Git is an open-source command line tool for managing code files.
GitHub and its primary competitors, GitLab and BitBucket, are commercial web products that use Git
Their websites give us a way to store our code that's managed by Git.
