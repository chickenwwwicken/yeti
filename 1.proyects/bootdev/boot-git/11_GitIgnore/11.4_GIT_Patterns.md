It would be rough if ```.gitignore``` files only accepted exact filepath section names
Let's go over some of the most common patterns.

#### WildCards
The ```*``` character matches any number of characters except for a slash (```/```)
To ignore all .txt files, you could use:

```
*.txt
```

#### Rooted Patterns
Patterns starting with a ```/``` are anchored to the directory containing the ```.gitignore``` file. 
For example, this would ignore a ```main.py``` in the root directory, but not in any subirectories.

```
/main.py
```

#### Negation
You can negate a pattern by prefixing it with an exclamation mark (```!```).
For example, to ignore all ```.txt``` files except for ```important.txt```, you could use this pattern:

```
*.txt
!important.txt
```

#### Comments
You can add comments to your ```.gitignore``` file by starting a line with a ```#``` 

```
# Ignore all .txt files
*.txt
```

You can read more about the patterns that are available in the [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) 

#### Assignment
Use this ```.gitignore``` file to answer the question:

```
# *.js

*.txt
!names.txt

/src/main.py

content.md
```
