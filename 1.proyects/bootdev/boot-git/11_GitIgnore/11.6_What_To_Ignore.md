The deeper question is what should we ignore...
Here are some rules:
1. Ignore things that can be generated (e.g. compiled code, minified files, etc.)
2. Ignore dependancies (e.g. ```node_modules```, ```venv```, ```packages```, etc.)
3. Ignore things that are personal or specific to how you like to work (editor settings)
4. Ignore things that are sensitive or dangerous (```.env``` files, passwords, API keys)

#### Assignment
Ignore a generated file. 
We ignore generated files because they can easily be regenerated from the stuff we track.
In this case, we're going to use ```Pandoc``` to generate HTML from a markdown file.
We'll ignore the HTML, file but commit the Markdown file.

First, install [Pandoc](https://www.pandoc.org/) , a command line tool for converting between different doc formats.

``` bash
sudo apt install pandoc
```

Run ```pandoc --version``` to ensure it's installed. 
See the [installation guide](https://www.pandoc.org/installing.html) if u having trouble.
Create a new file at the root of the repo called ```advert.md``` with the following.

```
# WebFlyx: The Future of Content

You thought you knew what the web was capable of. You were *wrong*. WebFlyx is taking the world of online entertainment to an entirely new level. Grab a copy of it at your local electronics store today!

**Available on Floppy Disk!**

*While supplies last.*
```

Run following command to generate an HTML document (webpage) from the Markdown file:

``` bash
pandoc advert.md -o advert.html
```

For fun, open the HTML in your browser to see a nicely formatted version of the md file.

``` bash
# WSL
explorer.exe advert.html

# Mac
open advert.html
```

Finally, add the ```advert.html``` file to the ```.gitignore``` file and commit your changes with a message starting with ```N:```

Run from the root of the project
