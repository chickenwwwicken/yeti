Git is *the* distributed Version Control System (VCS). 
Nearly every developer in the world uses it to manage their code. 
It has quite a monopoly on VCS. 

Devs use Git to:
- Keep a history of their code changes
- Revert mistakes made in their code
- Collaborate with other developers
- Make backups of their code

In 2005 after Issues with *BitKeeper* Linus Torvald gets mad and writes GIT in 5 days
Today this is the standard.

Git allows you to track code changes over time by author with a set of commands to:
- search
- manipulate
- revert history

In simple terms, GIT creates a commit which is:
- a set of changes tied to an author time of day and other information 

1. As many commits as you want can be added to the graph
2. At any commit you can branch off and create new commits on the new line 
3. Any of these branches can be merged into any other branch, including main line
4. Commits can be squashed into one squashed commit
5. Commit messages can be edited
6. Commits can be reverted

Over the course we gonna:
1. Install and configure Git
2. Porcelain and plumbing commands
3. Inspecting git history
4. branching
5. merging
6. rebasing
7. undoing changes
8. remote repos & github
