A file can be in one of [several states](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_the_very_basics) in a Git repo
Here are a few important ones:
- ```untracked```: Not being tracked by Git
- ```staged```: Marked for inclusion in the next commit
- ```committed```: Saved to the repo's history

The ```git status``` command shows you the current state of ur repo.
It will tell u which files are at which state.
