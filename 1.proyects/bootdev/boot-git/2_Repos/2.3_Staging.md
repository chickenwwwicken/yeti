The ```contents.md``` file has been created (untracked)
We need to stage it (add it to the "index") with the ```git add``` comand before committing it.

Without staging, every file in the **repository** would be included in every commit, but that's often not what you want

Here's the command: 

```git add <path-to-file | pattern>```

For example: 

``` bash
git add i-use-arch.btw
```

#### Assignment
1. Add ```contents.md``` to the staging area.
2. Run ```git status``` again. 
3. Run and submit the CLI tests
