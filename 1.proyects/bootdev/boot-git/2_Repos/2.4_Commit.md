After staging a file, we can commit it.

A commit is a snapshot of the repo at a given point in time. 
It's a way to save the state of the repo, 
and it's how Git keeps track of changes to the project.
A commit comes with a message that describes the changes made in the commit. 

Here's how to commit all of your staged files: 
``` bash
git commit -m "your message here"
```

### Assignment

1. Commit the ```contents.md``` file with the message ```A: add contents.md``` 
(*You dont normally use 'A:' but we doin it to easily identify commits*)
2. Run ```git status``` again, and u should see that the file is no longer staged. 
3. Run and submit the CLI tests from inside the ```webflyx``` directory. 

#### TIP 
If you screw a commit message
U can change it with ```amend``` flag. 
``` bash
# Change the last commit message
git commit --amend -m "A: add contents.md"
```
