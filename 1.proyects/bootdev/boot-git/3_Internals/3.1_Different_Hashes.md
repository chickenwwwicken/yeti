While commit hashes *are* derived from their content changes, there's also some other stuff that affects the end hash
For example: 
- The commit message
- The author's name and email
- The date and time
- Parent (previous) commit hashes

All this is to say that hashes are almost always unique, and because they're generated automatically for you, you don't need to worry too much about what goes into them right now. 

#### Note: Hash = Sha
Git uses a cryptographic hash function called SHA-1 to generate commit hashes
