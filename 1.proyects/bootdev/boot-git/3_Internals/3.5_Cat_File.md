Git has a built-in plumbing command, ```cat-file``` 
It allows us to see the contents of a commit without needing to futz around with the object files directly. 
``` bash
git cat-file -p <hash>
```

#### Assignment 
Use the ```cat-file``` command to view the contents of your last commit. 

##### Pass An Argument To The CLI
Notice that the ```bootdev``` CLI test for this lesson takes an additional argument denoted by a $1
``` bash
git cat-file -p $1
```

You need to provide the hash of ur last commit so that the CLI can run the command for you.

*Synopsis* 

```
git cat-file <type> <object>
git cat-file (-e | -p) <object>
git cat-file (-t | -s) [--allow-unknown-type] <object>
git cat-file (--textconv | --filters)
	     [<rev>:<path|tree-ish> | --path=<path|tree-ish> <rev>]
git cat-file (--batch | --batch-check | --batch-command) [--batch-all-objects]
	     [--buffer] [--follow-symlinks] [--unordered]
	     [--textconv | --filters] [-Z]
```

*Description* 
Output the contents or the other properties such as size, type or delta info of one or more objects. 

This command can operate in two modes, depending on whether an option from the 
```--batch``` family is specified. 

In non-batch mode, the command provides information on an object named on the command line. 

In batch mode, arguments are read from standard input.
