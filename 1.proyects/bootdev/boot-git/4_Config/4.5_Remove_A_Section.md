As I pointed out before, the ```webflyx``` section is nonsensical because Git doesn't use it for anything. 
While we can store any key/value pairs we want in our Git configuration, it doesn't mean we should.

The ```--remove-section``` flag is used to remove an entire section from your Git configuration. For example: 

``` bash
git config --remove-section section
```

#### Assignment 
Remove the entire ```webflyx``` section from your local Git config. 
You  might notice that the default "core" section is still there, that's ok.
