There are several locations where Git can be configured. From more general to more specific:

- **system**: ```/etc/gitconfig```, a file that configures Git for all users on the system
- **global**: ```~/.gitconfig``` , a  file that configures Git for all projects of a user
- **local:** ```.git/config```  , a file that configures Git for a specific project
- **worktree**: ```.git/config.worktree```, a file that configures Git for part of a project

90% of the time u will be using ```--global``` to set things like ur username and email. 
The other 9% of the time you will be using ```--local``` to set project-specific configurations. 
The last 1% of the time you *might* need to futz with system and worktree configurations, but it's rare.  

#### OverRiding
If you set a configuration in a more specific location, it will override the same configuration in a more general location. For example, if you set ```user.name``` in the local configuration, it will override the ```user.name``` set in the global configuration

En resumen git va a utilizar primero Worktree, luego Local, luego Global.

Global = User's $ Home dir  ($Home = ~/)
