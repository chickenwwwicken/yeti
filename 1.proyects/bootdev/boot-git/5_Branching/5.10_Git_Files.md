KungFu? No, *GitFu*

Remember, Git stores all its info in files in the .git subdir at the root of your project, even info about branches. 
The "heads" (or tips) of branches are stored in the ```.git/refs/heads``` dir. 
If you ```cat``` one of the files in that dir, you should be able to see the commit hash that the branch points to. 

#### Assignment 
Use ```find``` and ```cat``` to find the commit hash that your ```main``` branch points to.
