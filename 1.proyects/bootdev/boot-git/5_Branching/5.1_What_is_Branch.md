A [Git Branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) allows you to keep track of different changes separately. 

For example, let's say you have a big web project and you want to experiment with changing the color scheme. 
Instead of changing the entire project directly (as of right now, our ```master``` branch), you can create a new branch called ```color_scheme``` and work on that branch. 
When you're done, if you like the changes, you can merge the ```color_scheme``` branch back into the ```master``` branch to keep the changes. 
If you don't like the changes, you can simply delete the ```color_scheme``` branch and go back to the ```master``` branch.

#### Under The Hood
A branch is just a named [pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)#:~:text=A%20pointer%20is%20a%20programming,than%20storing%20the%20data%20itself.) to a specific commit. 
When you create a branch, you are creating a new pointer to a specific commit. 
The commit that the branch points to is called the tip of the branch.

Because a branch is just a pointer to a commit, they're lightweight and 'cheap' resource-wise to create. 
When you create 10 branches, you're not creating 10 copies of your project on your hard drive. 

#### Assignment
Check which branch you're currently on by running: 
``` bash
git branch
```

#### TIP
Remember you should be on ```master``` because we set ```init.defaultBranch``` to ```master``` at the start of the course.
