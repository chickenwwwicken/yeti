We will use text to represent branches and commits. Forr example
```
A - B - C main
```

means a branch called ```main``` with 3 commits. ```C``` isthe most recent commit (the tip), ```B``` is the previous commit, and ```A``` is the commit before that. 
To represent multiple branches, we'll use multiple lines: 
```
     D - E  other_branch
    / 
  A - B - C  main
```
