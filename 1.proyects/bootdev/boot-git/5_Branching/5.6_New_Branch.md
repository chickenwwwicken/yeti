You should already be on the ```main``` branch: your "default" branch.
You can always check with ```git branch``` 

#### Two Ways to Create A Branch
``` bash
git branch my_new_branch
```

This creates a new branch called ```my_new_branch```. 
The thing is, I rrarely use this command because usually I want to create a branch and switch to it immediately. 
So I use this command:
``` bash
git switch -c my_new_branch
```

The switch command allows u to switch branches and the ```-c``` flag tells Git to create a new branch if it doesn't already exist.

When you create a new branch, it uses the *current commit* you are on as the branch base.
For example, if you're on your ```main``` branch with 3 commits, ```A```, ```B``` and ```C```, and then you run  ```git switch -c my_new_branch``` , your new branch will look like this:

#### Assignment
Create and switch to a new branch called ```add_classics```, it should have the same commits as the ```main``` branch. 

Run ```git branch``` to verify that you are on the new branch
