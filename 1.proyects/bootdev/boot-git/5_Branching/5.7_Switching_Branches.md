There's another command that you'll certainly run into because it's been around for a long time and older devs are used to it: ```git checkout```.
``` bash
# new way
git switch add_classics

# old way
git checkout add_classics
```

#### Assignment
1.  Switch to ```main```
2. Run ```git branch``` to make sure it worked
3. Switch back to ```add_classics```
4. Run ```git branch``` to make sure it worked.
5. Run and submit the CLI tests.
