What's the point of having multiple branches? 
They're  most often used to safely make  changes  without affecting your primary branch.
However, once you're happy with your changes you wanna merge them back into main branch,

#### Visual
``` 
A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    other_branch
```

If you merge other_branch into main, Git combines both branches by creating a new commit that has both histories as parents.  
In diagram below, ```F``` is a  merge commit that has ```C``` and ```E``` as parents
```F``` brings all the changes from ```D``` and ```E``` back into the ```main``` branch. 
```
A - B - C - F    main
   \     /
    D - E        other_branch
```

#### Assignment
Switch back to ```main```. 
Update ```contents.md``` file with:
```
# contents

* titles.md: The movie titles in the WebFlyx collection
* classics.csv: A comma-separated list of classic movies
* quotes: A directory of files containing memorable quotes from movies
```

Commit changes with a message starting with ```E:``` 

Commit history should look like this
```
A - B - C - E    main
         \
           D     add_classics
```

Run ```git log --online --graph --all``` and you should see a nice ASCII art  representation of commit history.
