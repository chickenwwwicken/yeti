The simplest type of merge is a fast-forward merge.
Example:
```
      C     delete_vscode
     /
A - B       main
```
And we run this while  on ```main```
```
git merge delete_vscode
```
Because ```delete_vscode```  has all the commits that ```main``` has, Git automatically does a fast-forward merge.
It just moves the pointer of the "base" branch to the tip of the "feature" branch:
```
            delete_vscode
A - B - C   main
```
With a fast-forward merge,  no merge commit is created.
This is a common workflow when working with Git on a team of devs:
1.  Create a branch for a new change
2. Make the change
3. Merge the branch back into ```main``` 
4. Remove the branch
5. Repeat

#### Assignment
Because the ```add_classics```  branch has been merged into ```main```, we don't need it anymore.
1. Delete the ```add_classics``` branch:
``` bash
git branch -d add_classics
```
2. Create a new branch off ```main``` called ```update_titles```. You can use ```git switch -c```
3. Add a commit to that branch that updates the ```titles.md``` file and add "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" as the final entry in the list of movies. Use ```G:``` to prefix the  commit message. 
4. Run ```git log --oneline``` to make sure the commit is there.
5. Run and submit the CLI tests from the ```update_titles``` branch.
