I want to stress how **dangerous** this command can be. 
If you were to simply delete a committed file, it would be trivially  easy to recover because it is tracked in Git.
However, if you used ```git reset --hard``` to undo committing that file, it would be deleted for good.

Always be careful when using  ```git reset --hard```. 
It's a powerful tool, but it's also a dangerous one.

#### Reset to a Specific Commit
If you want to reset back to a specific commit, you can use the ```git reset --hard``` command and provide a commit hash. 
For example:

``` bash
git reset --hard COMMITHASH
```

This will reset your working directory and index to the state of that commit, and all the changes made after that commit are lost forever.
