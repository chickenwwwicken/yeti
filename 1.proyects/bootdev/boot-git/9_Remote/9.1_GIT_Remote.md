Often our frenemies (read: coworkers) make code changes that we need to  begrudgingly accept into our pristine bug-free repos.

This is where the :distributed" in "distributed version control system" comes from.
We can have "remotes", which are just external repos with mostly the same Git history as our local repo.

When it comes to Git (the CLI tool), there really isn't a "central" repo. 
GitHub is just someone else's repo. 
Only by  convention and convenience, have we, as devs, started to use GitHub as a "source  of truth" for our code. 

#### Assignment
Let's create a second repo called "webflyx-local" as a sibling directory to our original  "webflyx"  repo.

Use cd, mkdir, and git init to create the new empty repo.

When ur done,  your directory structure should look like this:

``` bash
webflyx/
  - stuff in the original repo
webflyx-local/
  - stuff we'll put in the new repo
```

Run and submit from inside the new ```webflyx-local``` dir
