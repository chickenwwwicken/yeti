In git, another repo is called a "remote."
The standard convention is that when you're treating the remote as the "authoritative source of truth" (such as GitHub) you would name it the "origin".

By "authoritative source of truth" we mean that it's the one you and your team treat as the "true" repo.
It's the one that contains the most up-to-date version of the accepted code. 

#### Command Syntax

``` bash
git remote add <name> <uri> 
```

#### Assignment
Inside new repo, add ```webflyx``` as a remote. 
Give it the name ```origin```
The ```uri``` should just be a relative path to the ```webflyx``` dir, in our case ```../webflyx```

Run from inside the new ```webflyx-local```
