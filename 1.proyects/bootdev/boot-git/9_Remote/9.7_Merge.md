Just as we merged branches within a single local repo, we can also merge branches between local and remote repos.

#### Syntax

``` bash
git merge remote/branch
```

For example, if you wanted to merge the ```primeagen``` branch of the remote ```origin``` into your local ```main``` branch, you would run this inside the local repo while on the ```main``` branch:

``` bash
git merge origin/primeagen
```

#### Assignment
Merge the remote ```origin/main``` into the local repo's ```main``` branch.
Because we are on an empty branch, we should get a nice clean fast-forward merge.

Make sure it worked with ```git log``` 
You should see all the same commits on your local ```main``` branch as you do on the remote ```origin/main``` branch.

Run from inside the new ```webflyx-local```
