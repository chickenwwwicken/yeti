## Emoji-history: the missing years
### 1959 
CO-59 is a character set created in 1959 for exchange of data between Japanese newspapers. In itt is included a symbol of a baseball, which again is still present in emoji and at Unicode codepoint U+26BE ⚾︎ today.

### 1965
"Full Moon with Face", also known as BA-90 which was listed in a book of typesetting symbols, published by Sha-ken in 1965.

### 1979 
We can see emoji in the character sets of Japanese home computers such as thhe *Sharp MZ-80K*, which included a UFO, smiley faces, stick figures, car, snake, and more.

### 1984
The Ishii Award was a typeface design contest organised by the community of type designers in 1970. By 1984 it was in its 8th year. Yutaka Satoh of Type-Labo proposed a typeface consisting of emoji. Because they weren't on screen they were created by arranging dots in vaarious shapes

### 1988 - [Sharp PA-8500 – The World's First Emoji Set?](https://blog.gingerbeardman.com/2024/05/10/emoji-history-the-missing-years/) 

##### How old is an emoji?
At this point we’ve wiped almost a decade off the creation date of emoji, but can we go further? Is there a way to date a set of emoji? In Japanese 絵文字 means emoji.

If we think about the PA line of devices, the _PA-8500_ was released in 1988, and it’s predecessor the (emoji-less) PA-7000 was released in 1987. So maybe the emoji set was created around this time? We can get closer by looking at a couple of characters present in the emoji that give us [a clue to the date of creation](https://srad.jp/~yasuoka/journal/495877/). That is indeed the case with the _Sharp PI-4000_ and _WD-A521_.

The characters [○金 and ○ビ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B8%A1%E8%BE%BA%E5%92%8C%E5%8D%9A#%E2%97%8B%E9%87%91%E3%83%BB%E2%97%8B%E3%83%93) (_maru-kin_ meaning rich/successful/winner and _maru-bi_ meaning poor/unsuccessful/loser) were invented by the author [Kazuhiro Watanabe](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B8%A1%E8%BE%BA%E5%92%8C%E5%8D%9A#%E2%97%8B%E9%87%91%E3%83%BB%E2%97%8B%E3%83%93) in 1984 in his book [Kinkonkan](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4072734365) which was later [made into a movie](https://www.nikkatsu.com/movie/26211.html). These were quickly accepted into Japanese vocabulary, winning the 84年の日本流行語 (Japanese Buzzwords Award 1984). And they are right there in the _Sharp PI-4000_ emoji, represented as characters enclosed in circles. They were in common use throughout Japan’s bubble-era, 1986-1991, but eventually fell out of fashion and are now considered obsolete. It’s interesting to note that they are not featured in either the [1997 _SoftBank_](https://emojipedia.org/softbank/1997) or [1999 _NTT DoCoMo_](https://emojipedia.org/docomo/1999) emoji sets.

### 1990 - NEC PI-ET1
The device is literally the coolest thing you've seen . With system software written by video game developer Hudson Soft its character set features emoji that can be typed inline, and it also features a "montage functtion" that allows you to create faces for each of yourr contacts -- 15 years later we'd see something similar on MII on Ninntenndo Wii in 2006. The emoji on this device are a lot less well designed, than those on the Sharp devices.

### 1994 - Sharp PI-4000
This is a pocket computer that rolled outt of Sharp's involvement in the development and manuffacturing of Apple's Newton MessagePad. In 1993 Sharp did their own licenced version of the Apople Newton MessagePad H1000, the Expert Pad PI-7000, but just like Apple's device it wasnt' as successful as they'd hoped. The PI-3000/4000 devices could transfer data via infrared, connect to a modem to sen dfaxes, and by the PI-5000 in 1995 could connect to cell phones to send emails. They all use a simplified--but still quite complicated--version of the multi-window operating system that had been developed for the PV-F1.

### 1997 - First Emoji Set on a  Mobile Phone
SoftBank, known as J-Phone at the time, releases the SkyWalker DP-211SW mobile phone on November 1, 1997, including a set of 90 distinct emoji characters, among them one of the most iconic emoji characters in the Unicode Standard, the poo emoji. It was earlier believed to have been the world's first known emoji set. It still believed to be the first emoji set included on a mobile phone.

The SoftBank emoji designs heavily influenced Apple's original emojis which was designed to be compatible with this set when launched in Japan, due to iPhone being a SoftBank-exclusive phone when first released.

Shigetaka Kurita himself [tweeted](https://twitter.com/sigekun/status/1080848236653334529) in January 2019 that “The first emoji use in mobile devices in Japan was a pager, but in mobile phones DoCoMo wasn't the first, I think it was J-PHONE DP-211SW”.

### 1999 - Shigetaka Kurita's 176 Emoji
Shigetaka Kurita creates 176 emojis for the release of the Japanese mobile phone operator NTT DoCoMo’s integrated mobile internet service “i-mode”, debuting in February of 1999. The service only allowed for 250 characters which gave Kurita the challenge to figure out a way to communicate in an expressive but short way. Even though the emoji set isn't the first, it is the first to get widespread use and ultimately make emoji a worldwide phenomenon.

### 2001 - Emoji Domains
On April 19, 2001, the first three today existing EMOJI.com domains were registered (The Hot Springs, Peace Sign and Male Symbol). ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) had made available a couple of hundred SYMBOL.com domain names. Symbols for “Registrered” and “Copyright”, was released that same day.

At that moment in time, these where not emojis but symbol characters that were standardized in Unicode in 1993. ICANN stopped registrations for these kind of domains in 2008.

In 2015 many of the registered symbols became adopted as emojis by Unicode. Of the SYMBOL.com domain registrations made before 2008, only 33 of them are EMOJI.com domains today, among them the Airplane, Watch and Snowflake.

Since then, other TLDs (top-level domains) not under the control of ICANN (who controls .com and .net), have open registrations for Emoji domains, such as .ws, .kz, .fm and .to.

### 2003 - Emoticons <3 MSN Messenger
With the [release of MSN Messenger 6](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2678358/applications/msn-messenger-6-looks-for-emotion.html) the instant messaging platform introduces 30 emoticons, including animated ones. Precursors to emojis, the users are also able to turn any image file into an emoticon and connect customized keyboard shortcuts to specific emoticons.

If a user is undecided, the program also offered a “Decision Wheel” which users can spin to decided which emoticon to use. Emoticons are part of their aim of making the program more personal.

### DEA's Emoji Drug Code
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the US publishes [multiple](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/OPCK_2.0_Emoji%20Codes-Poster.pdf) [versions](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/Emoji%20Drug%20Code%20PDF_Final.pdf) of an [Emoji Drug Code fact sheet](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/Emoji%20Decoded.pdf).

> "Emojis were originally designed to represent an emotion, event, or activity, but have recently taken on a language of their own. Criminal organizations, including drug traffickers, have noticed and are using emojis to buy and sell counterfeit pills and other illicit drugs on social media and through e-commerce. This reference guide is intended to give parents, caregivers, educators, and other influencers a better sense of how emojis are being used in conjunction with illegal drugs." / DEA

The reference guide is part of the DEA:s “[One Pill Can Kill](https://www.dea.gov/onepill)” Campaign.

### 2024 - Emojam - Sega's Emoji-Only Pager. 
On December 10, Sega releases [Emojam](https://www.segatoys.co.jp/emojam/) as part of their Japanese-based kids brand LinkLink. According to the [press release](https://www.sega.jp/topics/detail/241031_1/), Sega says this device is trying to bring back the “pager culture” of the 1990s, but with Emojam you can only communicate with emojis, not text nor numbers.  

You can arrange up to 10 emojis in a row to send to other Emojam users, which Sega likens to a secret code between friends. It offers over 1,400 emojis, with an Emoji Lab feature that can combine two emojis into a new one. However, the emojis on offer are not those provided by the Unicode Consortium. Sega’s images include Hello Kitty, for example.

To ensure a safe experience for kids, you must physically touch two Emojams together to add friends and be able to start chatting. The devices use Wi-Fi to communicate and come with fun-colored cases and beaded straps.

Emojam are currently only available in Japan.
