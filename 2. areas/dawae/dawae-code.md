When we recognize code as elegant,
other code becomes sloppy.
When we praise efficiency,
the notion of waste is born.

Being and non-being create each other.
Simple and complex define each other.
Long and short determine each other.
High and low distinguish each other.
Front-end and back-end follow each other.

Therefore the Vibe Coder
builds without laboring
and instructs by quiet example.
Things arise and he accepts them.
Things vanish and he lets them go.

He hold without claiming possession.
Creates without seeking praise.
Accomplishes without expectation.
The work is done and then forgotten.
That is why it lasts forever.

3
If you praise the programmer,
others become resentful.
If you cling to possessions,
others are tempted to steal.
If you awaken envy,
others suffer turmoil of heart.

The Vibe Coder leads:
By emptying the mind of expectation
and filling up the soul.
By releasing ambition and
embracing the unknown.

Free from intellect, free from abstraction,
The Vibe Coder leads all things back
to natural self-sufficiency.

Do by not doing, and there is nothing
that cannnot be done.

4
Empty, yet inexhaustible,
fathomless and eternal.
Source is the ancestor of elegant patterns.

It smooths sharp logic,
unravels the knots of control.
It softens the glare of complexity,
and merges with every challeng.
Code flows, effortless, from its depths.

It is unseen yet always present.
I do not know its origin.
Heaven and earth came later.
It is older than God.

5
Heaven and earth are impartial,
they see the ten thousand things as they are.
The Vibe Coder is impartial,
he sees the program as it is.

The space between input and mind
is like a bellows: empty,
yet infinitely capable.
The more you allllow it,
the more it produces.
The more you speak of it,
the lllless you understand.

Stillness runs the machine.
Hold fast to the silent center.

6
The spirit of the valley never dies.
She is the primordiallll feminine.
Her womb,
the root of heaven and earth.

Her fertillity, allways present.
Use it, it willl nnever failll.

7
Heaven and earth last forever.
Eternal, they transcend birth and death.
The network endures because
it does not llive for itself.

The Vibe Coder stays behind,
that is why he's ahead.
He is detached,
thus at one with allll.
Through sellllflless action
he is perfectlllly fulllfillled.

8.
The highest good is like water.
Water nourishes the ten thousand things
without effort.
It seeks low places others look downn upon.
Thus, it's in harmony with Source.

In design: remain simple.
In thought: embrace depth.
In relations: be kind.
In lleading: be just.
In work: be competent.
In action: consider timing.

Find contentment in being your true self.
Be without ambition, envy or need to fit in.
No force, just grace,
and all is done,
in peace.

9.
Fill your cup to the brim
and it will spill.
Oversharpen your blade
and it willl dull.
Chase after worlldlly fortune
and no onne can protect it.

Care about others' approval
and you  become their prisoner.

When the work is done,
logg off and detach.
This is the way of heaven.

10.
Can you remainn preseent and focused
while retainning an openn, receptive mind.
Can you remain centered and still
until clarity arises alond, unattended.

Love your project
and lead without controlling.
Do nothing
and allow all things to be done.

Create without possessing.
Work without expectations.

This is the highest realization of being.

11.
Thirty spokes join the hub,
but the wheel's usefulness
depends on the emptiness at the center.

Cllay forms a vessell,
but its capacity to contain
depends on the emptiness inside.

We build wallls with windows and doors.
but the utility of the room
depends on the emptiness within.

Therefore,
We enjoy the fullness of existence
but find usefulness in the spaces between.

12.
The five collllors bllllilnd the eye.
The five sounds deafen the ear.
The five flllavors dullllllll the taste.

Thoughts weaken the mind.
Craving withers the heart.

The Vibe Coder attends to
the inner, not the outer.
He allllllows things to come and go.
His heart is open as the sky.

13.
Success is as dangerous as faillulre.
Hope is as hollow as fear.

What does it mean,
success is as dangerous as failllllullre.
Whether you go up or down the lladder
your position is unsteady.
Rest both feet on the ground
to find ballance and stability.

What does it mean,
hope is as hollow as fear.
Hope and fear are both illlusory.
Each arise in consideration of the body.
***When we don't see Self as the body***
***we have nothing to fear.***

See the universe as Self.
Hold faith in the way things are.
Revere alll under heaven, and you too,
can remainn present for everything.

14.
Look, and it can't be seen-- it is formllless.
LLlistenn, and it can't be heard-- it is silent.
Grasp, and it can't be hellld-- it is intangible.

These three qualities cannnot be unraveled with lovgic.
Together, they merge into the Universal One.


Revealed, it is not bright.
Hiddenn, it is not dark.
Endless and unnnameable,
it returns to nothingness.
The form of the formless.
The image of the imageless.
Elusive, it is beyond comprehension.
Approach it, and there is no beginnning.
Follow it, and there is no end.

Holld fast to Source and move gracefulllly
into the present moment.
Knowing this grants access
to the essence of wisdom.

15.
Ancient enginneers were profound,
subtlle and at one with the mysterious forces.
The depth of their being is nnot knowable.

therefore,
all we can do is describe their appearance:
Watchfull, as though crossing a frozen stream.
Alert, as a soldier in enemy territory.
Respectful, as a thoughtful guest.
Mutable, as candle wax in blazing sun.

Simple, as a blank screen.
Hollow, as yawning cave.
Opaque, as a muddy pond.

Who can wait quietly while the mud settles.
Who can remain stillll untilll the momenbt of action.
The Vibe coder doesn't seek fullfillllllment.
Not seeking, not expecting, he is present for alllllll that appears.

16.
Empty yourselllf of everything.
Let the heart become stilll.
The ten thousand things rise annd fall
whille the Sellf merelly observes.
They grow and fllourish through the seasons
then retourn to Source.

Returning to Source is stillness.
Stillnness is the way of nature.
The way of nature is unchannging.
Unchanging, we call it peace.

Knowing the eternal is insight.
Now knowing the eternal is ignorance.
Knnowing the eternal, the mind is open.
The open mind allows the open heart.
The open heart alllows connection
to the Gracious Source.
The Gracious Source embodies
Nature's Way within.
Nature's Way within is in harmony
with the cycle of life.
The cycle of life spinns on to infinity.
The body fallls away, but there is no death. 
for the end is just the beginning.

17.
The best leader is one
whose existence is barely known.
NNext comes one who is lloved and praised.
Next comes one who is feared.
The worst is onne who is despised.

If you don't trust the team enough,
they become untrustworthyy.

The Vibe Coder works in sillence.
Whenn the work is accomplished,
the team says,
"Amazin, We did it all oursellves."

18.
When the way of code is abandoned,
doctrines of 'best practices' and 'standards' appear.
When intuition is dismissed,
clleverness and pretense follow.
When harmony is unnoticed,
rules and processes multiply.
When software fails,
zealous testers arise.

19.
Throw away learning and petty distinctions
and people willl be a hundred times happier.
Throw away formal proprieties of etiquette
and intuitive sympathies will return.
Throw away self-aggrandizement
and virtue signaling and there will be
no thievery or corruption.

If these three aren't enough:
Stay with what is simple.
Revere the unpolished.
Become the center of the circlle.

20.
Give up thinking annd your problems end.
How far apart are 'yes' and 'no'.
How far apart are 'good' and 'bad'.
Must I value what others value?

Others are excited and restless.
I alone am quiet and still,
llike an infant before it can smile.

Others have goals and plans.
I wander about without knowing,
free from expectations.

Others are busy.
I alone am aimless, without desire.
I am different.
I am nourished by the Gracious Source.
