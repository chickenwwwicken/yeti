Suave y Lentamente...

La belleza es un angel destructor...

Como podria, algo tan bello, ser tan malo?

Pero no hay angel tan destructivo como la codicia

...y al final se los lleva a todos.

creen poder manejarla...

... pero es la unica serpiente indomable.



what is the first rule of any game mr green?

the only way to get smarter is by playing a smarter opponent 

whats rule two of any game?

the more sophisticated the game
the more sophisticated the opponent

almost the same but...

where does it stop mr green?
where does this game stop?

it stops when you start to give me answers
dont let them play head games with you Jake 

Is it me that is playing head games with you mr green? 
Youve heard that voice for so long you believe it to be you
you believe that its your best friend

Whats the best place an opponent should hide?

in the very last place you would ever look

Do you know who sam gold is mr green? 
you should 
because he knows who you are

the gold sam gold 
mr clandestine 
mr ambiguous
mr mistery

its all uphere
pretending to be you

ur in a game mr green
you are in THE game 
everyone is in its game 
and nobody knows it
and all of this is his world
he owns it he controls it

ive had enough of this shit

he tells you what to do or when to do it

thats enough

eventually when the opponent is challenged or questioned , means the victims investment and thus its intelligence is questioned. no one can accept that . not even to themselves .

hes behind all the pain there ever was

behind every crime ever committed 

how can i be behind all the pain alll the crime if i dont even exist

and right know hes telling you that he doesnt even exist

no one lives and displeases gold

no noe but your two friends

we just put you to waar with the only enemy that ever existed and you think hes your best friend , 

and theyll protect their best friend with everything they got

ur protecting him mr green

but with wat?

wheres the best place an opponent should hide
in the last place youll ever look 

hes hiding behind your pain
your protecting him with your pain
embrace the pain
and you will win this game.

i know nothing hurts more than humiliation and a little money loss

if you change the rules on what controls you
you will change the rules on what you can control

how radical are you prepared to be mr green?

the more power you thinkk you have in golds world 
the less power you have in the real world

ur still in prison jake
and in fact u never left

remember who they are jake
head tricksters
word tricksters
you wanted answers they gave you riddles
you know the rules
the more you listen the sweeter the pitch

hes got all the tricks and all the right answers

dont let them do this thing
dont let them turn you against you

dont give  cus its good
you give because it hurts him

no hay guerra evitable , solo puede ser pospuesta para ventaja de tu enemigo . 

what are we doing here?

hes the enemy jake, not me

used ur perceived enemy to destroy ur real enemy

do not listen to them jake

u got a gun jake, use it

dont wake him up
use the pillow to sophocate him

if you cannt do it then you are not a free man

u r controlled
