## Instrucciones

RSIC: A PEER-TO-PEER RUNE ALLOCATION SYSTEM

This is the first "not first" rune on bitcoin.

Read the rules of the game below if you choose to play.

SUPPLY CHAIN:

- Factory. Purpose: produce RSICs.
- RSIC Distribution Centers. Purpose: distribute RSICs.
- RSICs (Rune Specific Inscription Circuits). Purpose: mine runes.
- Foundry. Purpose: etch runes.
- Rune Distribution Centers. Purpose: distribute allocated runes.

SITUATION:

A technological arms race has begun. 21,000 cutting-edge RSICs,
manufactured in our Factory, are being sent from our Distribution
Centers to the Ordinals community. The RSICs are designed for the
sole purpose of securing a bag of runes. These runes will be etched,
in our Foundry, after the runes protocol launches on bitcoin.

RULES OF THE GAME:

1. All RSICs are inscriptions. 21,000 were manufactured in total.
   Our factory and distribution centers have since mysteriously exploded.
2. All RSICs are being distributed to the Ordinals community. Free.
3. RSIC holders have 3 choices: (1) mine runes. (2) sell RSICs on
   market. (3) fade.
4. RSICs must be activated before they start mining. To
   activate your RSIC, transfer it once (own address OK).
5. Every bitcoin block, runes will be allocated to the address
   holding activated RSIC(s). Until the supply is fully allocated.
6. Rune allocations stack (more RSICs = more runes). There is no
   limit on the number of RSICs per address.
7. There are 4 types of rune allocation:
   flat, random, boosted, and halvening.
8. 10% of RSICs are reserved for the game designers.

RUNE ALLOCATION TYPES & DISTRIBUTION:

1. FLAT (up to 30% of fully diluted rune supply): a flat reward of
   21 runes per block per active RSIC.

2. BOOSTED (up to 30% of fully diluted rune supply): a single boost
   will be available to all RSICs. The instructions will be published
   on Sat 4703400000000.This is a hash of the instructions for how to
   activate the boost:
   75213f19413514e4ab30ba79a6b5713e333c91e7679c35dca979f70ea5f9c1f5.

3. RANDOM (25% baseline + residual runes from flat and boosted):
   an additional reward per block allocated via random hash alignment.
   If your RSICs type code aligns with the last digit of a given
   blockhash, your RSIC mines 336 runes in that block. All RSICs
   indicate hash alignment with current block with a visual cue (hint:
   orange).

4. HALVENING: 5 allocations (5% + 4% + 3% + 2% + 1% of fully diluted
   rune supply) will be made on block 840,000.  Each RSIC gets one
   ticket for this raffle for every consecutive block it was held in
   the address holding it when block 840,000 is mined.

"Each player must accept the cards life deals him or her: 
 but once they are in hand, he or she alone must decide
 how to play the cards in order to win the game." -- Voltaire



Good luck players.
