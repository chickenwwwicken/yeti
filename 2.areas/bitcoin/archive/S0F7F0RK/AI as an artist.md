"My imagination wants to fall out of me, and I’ve learned that it doesn’t really care what medium it comes out in." 

 I have watched as artists and other creatives around me have reacted with everything from skepticism, to fear, to profound revulsion.

 I have already had my mourning period.

I’ll tell you what I see now.

 I see something that will take me closer to my dream. I see a new creative multi-tool.
 
 The suggestion of an entirely new medium — and it may be the most transformative medium yet; the crafting of goals and intentions.

we fear that AI is drinking our milkshake.

The genie cannot be put back in the bottle because it was never in a bottle to begin with. All we’ve done is assemble the pieces we already had.

 we must not shrink away from this challenge. Instead, we must all embark on a personal journey that relocates us into this new frontier.

 Your talent is not in your wrist, or in your creative implements, your talent is who you are. Your perspective. Your choices. Your taste.

Removing creative limitations won’t create more competition for you, it will create less

 Interfaces have not yet been devised to meet artists and craftspeople where they are, in order to leverage their existing skills.

But they will come. 

We will make them.


 difference between the art that you make as a human, and what AI generates, is that one of those things is produced by a human. '
 
 This might seem obvious but it’s actually really subtle… 
 
 you are a puny, limited mortal monkey and your works are scarce, and precious, and embedded in space and time and human relationships— 
 
 contrasted against the detached creative potential of a boundlessly expanding immortal intelligence literally trained on all of human creation.

 AI models are just externalizations of our collective unconscious

But they don’t know where our choices ultimately fall. They can’t predict what we will do next.

And if they ever can, we will turn our attention toward proving their predictions wrong

because that is what we do. The artist finds a way.


AI is only involved in what you do because you do it. 

If you did something else, something no one’s ever done, AI would do that too.
