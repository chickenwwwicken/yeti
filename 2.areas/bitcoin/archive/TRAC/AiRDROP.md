AIRDROP WILL ENCOMPASS THREE PRIMARY SEGMENTS : 
- HOLDERS
- PARTICIPANTS
- BUILDERS

Conducted in two phases over a few months

$TRAC being the original token of the ecosystem , 80%

$PiPE main token of PiPE PROTOCOL , 2-%

$-Tap wont be airdrop , but something will be made available after the launch of token

### Phase 1

The first phase of the airdrop will involve a straightforward balance snapshot on the 28th of February. We will assess the holdings of $TRAC and $PIPE in each wallet and distribute the airdrop on a pro-rata basis at the market launch of $TAP token.

### Phase 2

A second snapshot will be taken at some point in Q2 2024. We will once again snapshot the wallets of holders and distribute a second batch of the $TAP airdrop to $TRAC & $PIPE holders.

Although this phase will airdrop $TAP tokens to new holders, we will also incentivise further wallets that have retained their $TRAC & $PIPE holdings between the two snapshots. These longer term holders will receive an additional 50% boost on the airdrop allocation.
