`raise` is like shouting, 'theres something wrong here buddy'
`Exception` is the thing thats wrong here buddy (`WandBrokenError` in example)
`except` is used to prevent the wrong from happening

example:
``` python
def spell_casting():
	# if wand is broken raise this *new_error_name* (*print this*)
    if wand_broken:
        raise Exception("Your wand snapped!")

try:
    spell_casting()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Oops! Time to visit Ollivander's. {e}")
```
