Code  is just a series of instructions that computers can follow.
Computers obey each  instruction, one after another.

Programs can be compromised of many instructions, like millions.

Addition is one of the most common instructions in coding.

#### Printing Numbers
```print()``` can print text using quotes:
``` python
print("whatever")
```

can also print numbers without quotes:
``` python
print(1)
```

you can also do math directly in parentheses:
``` python
print(1+1)
```
