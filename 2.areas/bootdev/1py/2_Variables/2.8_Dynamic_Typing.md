Python is a [dynamically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_and_dynamic_type_checking_in_practice) 
All this means is that a variable can store any type, and that type can change.

For example if I make a number variable, I can later change that variable to string.

``` python
speed = 5
speed = "five" 
```

#### Just because you can doesn't mean you should!
In almost all circumstances, it's a bad idea to change the type of a variable. 
The "proper" thing to do is to just create a new one. 

``` python
speed = 5
speed_description = "five"
```

#### What if it weren't dynamically typed?
Languages that aren't dynamically typed are statically typed.
In a statically typed language, if you try to assign a value to a variable of the wrong type,
an error would crash the program.
