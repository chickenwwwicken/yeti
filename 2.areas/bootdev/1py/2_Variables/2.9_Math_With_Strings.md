When working with strings the ```+``` operator performs a "concatenation".

"Concatenation" means joining two strings.
You should prefer string interpolation with ```f-strings``` over concatenation.

``` python
first_name = "Lane "
last_name = "Wagner"
full_name = first_name + last_name
print(full_name)
# prints "Lane Wagner"
```
