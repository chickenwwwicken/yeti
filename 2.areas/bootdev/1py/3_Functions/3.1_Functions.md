Functions allow us to reuse and organize code. 
For example, say we've written some code that calculates the area of a circle:

``` python
radius = 5
area = 3.14 * radius * radius
```

The problem is when we want to calculate the area of more circles, each w own properties.
We could just copy the code and change the variable names like this: 

``` python
radius = 5
area1 = 3.14 * radius * radius

radius2 = 7
area2 = 3.14 * radius2 * radius2
```

Instead, we can define a new function called ```area_of_circle``` using the ```def``` keyword.

``` python
def area_of_circle(r):
	pi = 3.14
	result = pi * r * r
	return result
```

The ```area_of_circle``` function takes one input and returns one output. 
The body of the function is indented and contains the code that will be run when the
function is called.
The ```return``` keyword tells the function to return the value that follows it as the output
of the function. 
The name of an input is called a parameter
In this case ```r``` 
The value of the input is called the argument.

To call this function (use it) we can now pass in any number as the argument (5)
for the parameter ```r``` , and capture the output into a new variable

``` python
area = area_of_circle(5)
print(area)
# 78.5
```

```5``` goes in as the input, ```r```, the result is calculated and ```78.5``` comes as the output.
Because the function is already defined, we can use it again with diff inputs.

``` python
area = area_of_circle(6)
print(area)
# 113.04
```
