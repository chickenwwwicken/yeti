``` python
def area_of_circle(r):
    pi = 3.14
    result = pi * r * r
    return result

radius = 5
area = area_of_circle(radius)
print(area)
# 78.5
```

Chronological explanation of what happens when this code is executed

1. ```def area_of_circle(r)```
The ```area_of_circle``` function is defined for later use, not called.
It accepts a single input (parameter) named ```r``` .
The body of the function is ignored now

2. ```radius = 5``` 
A new variable called ```radius``` is created and set to the value ```5```

3. ```area_of_circle(radius)```
The ```area_of_circle``` function is called with ```radius``` as the input.
Finally, jump back to the function definition.

4. ```def area_of_circle(r):```
Executing the body of the function and ```r``` -> ```radius``` -> ```5``` 

5. ```pi = 3.14``` 
A new variable called ```pi``` is created with a value of ```3.14``` 

6. ```result = 3.14 * r * r```
Some simple math is evaluated (```3.14 * 5 * 5```) and stored in the ```result``` variable.

7. ```return result```
The result variable is returned from the function as output.

8. ```area = area_of_circle(radius)``` 
The returned value is stored in a new variable called ```area``` (in this case ```78.5```)

9. ```print(area)```
The value of ```area``` is printed to the console
