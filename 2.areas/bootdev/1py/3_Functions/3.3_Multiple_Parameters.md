Functions can have multiple parameters (which is just a fancy name for "inputs")
For example, this ```subtract``` function accepts 2 parameters: ```a``` and ```b``` 

``` python
def subtract(a, b):
    result = a - b
    return result
```

Naming parameters < Setting their order. (Setting order is more important)
You call it like this

``` python
result = subtract(5, 3)
print(result)
# 2
```

This next function accepts 4 parameters

``` python
def create_introduction(name, age, height, weight):
    first_part = "Your name is " + name + " and you are " + age + " years old."
    second_part = "You are " + height + " meters tall and weigh " + weight + " kilograms."
    full_intro = first_part + " " + second_part
    return full_intro
```

It can be called like this:

``` python
my_name = "John"
my_age = "30"

intro = create_introduction(my_name, my_age, "1.8", "80")
print(intro)
# Your name is John and you are 30 years old. You are 1.8 meters tall and weigh 80 kilograms.
```
