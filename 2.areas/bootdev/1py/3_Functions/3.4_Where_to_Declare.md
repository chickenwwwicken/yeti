The following doesn't work
``` python
print(my_name)
my_name = 'chicken little'
```

needs to be: 
``` python
my_name = 'chicken little'
print(my_name)
```

Lines of code execute in order from top to bottom.
Variables need to be created before it can be used.
Functions need to be created before being executed.

The ```main()``` function is a convention used in many programming languages to specify
Entry point of an application.
By defining a single ```main``` function, and only calling ```main()``` at the end of the entire
program we ensure that all of are functions are defined before they're being called.

``` python
# Example
def main():
	print("Hello")
	print("hello")

main()
```
