All functions must be defined before they're used.

You might think this would make structuring Python code hard because the order of the
functions needs to be just right. 
As it turns out, there's a simple trick that makes it super easy.

Most Python devs solve this problem by defining all the functions in their program first, then 
finally calling the "entry point" function last.
Conventionally this "entry point" is ```main``` to keep things simple.

If you follow this pattern you can forget about ordering.
All of the functions have been read by the Python interpreter before the first one is called. 

``` python
def main():
    health = 10
    armor = 5
    add_armor(health, armor)

def add_armor(h, a):
    new_health = h + a
    print_health(new_health)

def print_health(new_health):
    print(f"The player now has {new_health} health")

# call entrypoint last
main()
```
