Python has a way to specify a default value for function arguments.
This can be convenient if a function has arguments that are "optional",
and you as the function creator want to use a specific default value in case the 
caller doesn't provide one.

A default value is created by using the assignment ```=``` operator in the function signature.

``` python
def get_greeting(email,name="there"):
	print("Hello", name, "welcome! ur email is:", email)
```

``` python
get_greeting("lane@example.com", "Lane")
# Hello Lane welcome! You've registered your email: lane@example.com
```

``` python
get_greeting("lane@example.com")
# Hello there welcome! You've registered your email: lane@example.com
```

If the second parameter is omitted, the default "there" value will be used in its place.

#### Assignment
Complete the ```get_punched``` and ```get_slashed``` functions. They should both:

- Take 2 integers as arguments, ```health``` and ```armor```
- Set ```armor``` to a ```default``` value of ```0```

##### ```get_punched```
- Create a ```damage``` variable equal to ```50``` minus the armor - the armor reduces the damage
- Create a ```new_health``` variable equal to the input ```health``` minus ```damage``` - we apply the damage
- Return ```new_health```

##### ```get_slashed```
- Create a ```damage``` variable equal to ```100``` minus the armor
- Create a ```new_health``` variable equal to the input ```health``` minus ```damage```
- Return ```new_health``` 

``` python
def get_punched(health, armor=0):
    damage = 50 - armor
    new_health = health - damage
    return new_health

def get_slashed(health, armor=0):
    damage = 100 - armor
    new_health = health - damage
    return new_health


# Don't touch below this line


def test(health, armor):
    print(f"Health: {health}, Armor: {armor}")
    print(f"Health after punch: {get_punched(health, armor)}")
    print("=====================================")
    print(f"Health: {health}, Armor: {armor}")
    print(f"Health after slash: {get_slashed(health, armor)}\n")
    print("=====================================")
    print(f"Health: {health}, Armor: no armor!")
    print(f"Health after slash: {get_slashed(health)}\n")
    print("=====================================")
    print(f"Health: {health}, Armor: no armor!")
    print(f"Health after punch: {get_punched(health)}")
    print("=====================================")


test(400, 5)
test(300, 3)
test(200, 1)
```
