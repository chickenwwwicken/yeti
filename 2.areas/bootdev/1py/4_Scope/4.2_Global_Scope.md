When we define a variable or a function, 
that name is accessible in every  other place in our program, even within other  functions.

```  python
pi = 3.14

def get_area_of_circle(radius):
    return pi * radius * radius
```

Because ```pi``` was declared in the parent "global" scope,
it is usable within  the ```get_area_of_circle()``` function.
