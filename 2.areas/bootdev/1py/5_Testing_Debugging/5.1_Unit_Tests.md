A unit test is  just an automated program that tests a small 'unit' of code.
Usually just a function or two. 
The editor will have tabs: the 'main.py' file  containing your code, and the 
'main_test.py' file containing the unit tests.

These unit-test-style lessons will test your code's functionality  rather than its output.
Our tests will call functions in your codes with different arguments, 
and expect certain  return values.
