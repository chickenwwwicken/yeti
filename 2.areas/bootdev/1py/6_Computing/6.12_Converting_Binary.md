Fantasy Quest needs to migrate old data.
Some of their legacy systems stored data as three binary strings to be converted to integers.

#### Assignment
Python has a built-in functionality to parse strings of 1's and 0's as binary numbers.

Complete the `binary_string_to_int` function.
It takes three binary strings as input and returns each of them in the same order as integers.
Each integer is the numerical value of the string when interpreted as binary. 

For example: 
``` python
data_a, data_b, data_c = binary_string_to_int("100", "101", "110")
print(data_a)
# 4
print(data_b)
# 5
print(data_c)
# 6
```

The built in `int` function can convert a binary string to an integer.
It takes a second argument that specifies the base of the number:
``` python
# this is a binary string
binary_string = "100"

# convert binary string to integer
num = int(binary_string, 2)
```

## Converting Strings to Binary

``` python
def binary_string_to_int(num_servers, num_players, num_admins):
    int_servers = int(num_servers, 2)
    int_players = int(num_players, 2)
    int_admins = int(num_admins, 2)
    return int_servers, int_players, int_admins

# inputs
# ("1", "10", "1010", (1, 2, 10))
# ("101", "11", "10100", (5, 3, 20)),
# ("111", "1011", "11010", (7, 11, 26)),
```
