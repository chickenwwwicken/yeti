Python has great outofthebox support for mathematical operations.
This among other reasons is its success in AI, ML, and Data Science apps.

Floor division is like normal division except the result is floored afterward, 
which means the remainder is removed. 
As you would expect, this means the result is an ```integer``` insteadd of `float`

``` python
7//2
# 2 (an integer)
```
