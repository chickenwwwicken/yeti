Python makes reassignment easy when math.
we use the `+=` "in-place operator" 

``` python
star_rating = 4
star_rating += 1
# star_rating is now 5
```

#### Other operators
``` python
star_rating = 4
star_rating -= 1
# star_rating is now 3

star_rating = 4
star_rating *= 2
# star_rating is now 8

star_rating = 4
star_rating /= 2
# star_rating is now 2.0
```

Cannot use these operators in return statements!!!
