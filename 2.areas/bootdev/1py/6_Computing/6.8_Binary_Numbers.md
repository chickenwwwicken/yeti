Binary  numbers are just base 2 numbers.
They work the  same way as base 10 numbers.
- Base-2 symbols: `0` `1` 
- Base-10 symbols: `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9` `0`  
Each  `1` in a binary  number represents an ever-greater multiple of 2.

- `0001` = 1
- `0010` = 2
- `0011` = 3
- `0100` = 4
- `0101` = 5
- `0110` = 6
- `0111` = 7
- `1000` = 8
- `1001` = 9
- `1010` = 10
- `1011` = 11
- `1100` = 12
- `1101` = 13
- `1110` = 14
- `1111` = 15
- `0000` = 0

You can write integers in Python with Binary Numbers, syntax is prefix `0b`

``` python
print(0b0001)
# Prints 1
```
