An `if` statement can be followed by zero or more `elif` (else if) statements.
Which can then be followed by zero or one `else` statements.

``` python
if score > high_score:
    print("High score beat!")
elif score > second_highest_score:
    print("You got second place!")
elif score > third_highest_score:
    print("You got third place!")
else:
    print("Better luck next time")
```

First the `if` statement is evaluated. 
If it is `True` then the if statement's body is executed and all other `else`s are ignored.

If the first `if` is `False` then the next `elif` is evaluated. 
If it is `True` then its body is executed and the rest are ignored.

If none of the `if` statements evaluate `True` the final `else` statement will be executed.

Basic Rules:
- Can't have an `elif` or an `else` without `if`
- You can have an `else` without an `elif`
