Boolean logic refers to logic dealing with boolean (`True` or `False`) values.

Logical operators `and` and `or` can be used to perform boolean logic.

The `and` operator returns `True` if both of the conditions on either side evaluates to `True`

``` python
def is_dog(num_legs, weight):
	return num_legs == 4 and weight < 100

# for num_legs = 4 and weight < 100
return 4 == 4 and 99 < 100
return True and True
return True

# for num_legs = 3 and weight = 99
return 3 == 4 and 98 < 100
return False and True
return False
```

The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one condition on either side evaluates to `True`

``` python
def is_car_cool(speed, is_electric):
	return speed > 200 or is_electric

# for non-electric and 250
return 250 > 200 or False
return True or False
return True
```

#### Assignment
function for tracking whether a character's attack hits or misses

Function should return `True` if either of the following conditions are met:
- The `attack_roll` is not a `1` and attack roll is `>=` `armor_class`, or
- The attack roll is a `20` 

Otherwise return `False` 

``` python
def does_attack_hit(attack_roll, armor_class):
    if (attack_roll != 1 and attack_roll >= armor_class) or attack_roll == 20:
        return True
    return False
```

U can use parentheses for order of operations 

``` python
# College admits students with a high GPA and high SAT score
# Or anyone who is rich
should_admit = (high_gpa and high_sat) or (is_rich)
```
