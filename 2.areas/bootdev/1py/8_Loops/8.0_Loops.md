## 8.2 Range loops with step

``` python
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
	print(i)
# prints : 0,2,4,6,8
```

``` python
for i in range(3, 0, -1)
	print(i)
# prints : 3, 2, 1
```

``` python
# inside a function for end and start variables
def count_down(start, end):
	for i in range(start, end, -1):
		print(i)
```

## sum of numbers in range

``` python
def sum_of_numbers(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end):
        total += i
    return total

## sum of odd numbers

``` python
def sum_of_odd_numbers(end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, end, 2):
        total += i
    return total

## 8.3 While loop health regeneration

``` python
def regenerate(current_health, max_health, enemy_distance):
    while current_health < max_health and enemy_distance > 3:
        current_health += 1
        enemy_distance -= 2
    return current_health
            
```

In `Fantasy Quest`, player characters regenerate health while standing still far from enemies.

`regenerate` function takes `current_health` `max_health` `enemy_distance` integers.
- while regenerating health, character gains health until it reaches `max_health`
- for every `1` health char gains, the `enemy_distance` shortens by `2`
- If enemy is a distance of `3` or less from char, char stops gaining health.
- Return `current_health` after it stops gaining health.

## Print 'Fight!' at 1

``` python
def countdown_to_start():
    for i in range(10 , 0, -1):
        if i > 1:
            print(f'{i}...')
    print(f'{1}...Fight!')

# 10...
# 9...
# 8...
# 7...
# 6...
# 5...
# 4...
# 3...
# 2...
# 1...Fight!
```

## Calculating Critical Hits

``` python
def calculate_flurry_crit(num_attacks, base_damage):
    total_damage = 0
    for i in range(0, num_attacks):
        if i == num_attacks -1:
            total_damage += base_damage*4
        else:
            total_damage += base_damage*2
    return total_damage
```

In the `calculate_flurry_crit` function, write a loop that calculates and returns the `total_damage` of the flurry.

The function takes 2 inputs `num_attacks`, `base_damage`.

Range over the `num_attacks` for the flurry
Calculate the total damage for each attack within the flurry. Remember, critical hits do double the `base_damage`!
The final swing of the flurry should do 4x the `base_damage`
Return the total damage

## Loop for Leveling up w XP

``` python
def calculate_experience_points(level):
    level_up_xp = 0
    total_xp = 0
    for i in range(level):
        total_xp += level_up_xp
        level_up_xp += 5   
    return total_xp
# or 
def calculate_experience_points(level):
    xp = 0
    for i in range(1, level):
        xp += i * 5
    return xp
```

Each character starts with 0 XP at level 1. 
To reach the next level, they need XP equal to their current level times 5.

## 8.4 Check if Prime number

``` python
def is_prime(number):	
	if number < 2:
		return False
	for i in range(2, number):
		if number % i == 0:
			return False
	return True
```

## Mana Meditating

``` python
def meditate(mana, max_mana, energy, energy_potions):
	# 
    while mana < max_mana and (energy > 0 or energy_potions > 0):
        if energy == 0:
            energy_potions -= 1
            energy += 50
        mana += 3
        energy -= 1
    if mana > max_mana:
        mana = max_mana
    return mana, energy, energy_potions
```

Complete the meditate function using a while loop. It takes `mana`, `max_mana`, `energy` and `energy_potions` integers.

- While meditating, a character converts `1` `energy` into up to `3` `mana` for each iteration of the loop.
- `mana` cannot exceed the `max_mana`.
- If they have any `energy_potions` when they run out of energy, they will use 1 energy potion to gain `50` `energy` and continue meditating.
- A character will stop meditating if either:
	- Their `mana` reaches the `max_mana`, or
	- They run out of `energy` and `energy_potions`.
Return the `mana` and remaining `energy` and `energy_potions` when the character stops meditating.

Tip
Don't forget! A character cannot have more `mana` than their `max_mana` threshold. Be sure to handle cases where meditate raises their `mana` above their max.
