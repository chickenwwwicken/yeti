Loops allow to do the same operation multiple times without having to write it explicitly each time.

For loop in Python is written like this:

``` python
for i in range(0,10):
	print(i)
```

`i` replaces the numbers `0` to `9` 

1. Start with `i` equals to `0` 
2. If `i` is not less than 10 (`range(0, 10)`), exit the loop.
	1. Print `i` to the console
	2. Add `1` to `i` (`range` defaults to incrementing by one)
	3. Go back to step `2`

The result is that the numbers `0-9` are logged to the console in order.

Body for a for-loop must be indented or syntax error
