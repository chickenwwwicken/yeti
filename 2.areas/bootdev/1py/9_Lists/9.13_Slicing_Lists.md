Python makes it easy to slice and dice lists to work only with section you care.
One way to do is to use the simple slicing operator : `:`

With this operator, u can specify where to start and end slice, and also step.
List slicing returns a new list from the existing list.

The syntax:

``` python
my_list[ start : stop : end]
```

For example:

``` python
scores = [50, 70, 30, 20, 90, 10, 50]
# Display list
print(scores[1:5:2])
# prints [70,20]
```

The above reads as "give slice of the `scores` list form index 1 up to index 5 (not including 5),
skipping every second value.

#### Omitting Sections
You can also omit various sections ("start", "stop", or "step")
Example: 

- `numbers[:3]` = get all items from start up until index 3
- `numbers[3:]` = get all items starting from index 3 to the end of list
- `numbers[::3]` = get every one other item starting from index 0

#### Negative Indices
Negative indices count from the end of the list. 
- `numbers[-3:]` = get all items starting from the last three items on index until last.
- `numbers[-1]` = get the last item on the index
