Built in keyword `del` that deletes items from objects.
In the case of a list, you can delete specific indexes or entire slices.

``` python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# delete the fourth item
del nums[3]
print(nums)
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# delete the second item up to (but not including) the fourth item
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
del nums[1:3]
print(nums)
# Output: [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# delete all elements
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
del nums[:]
print(nums)
# Output: []
```
