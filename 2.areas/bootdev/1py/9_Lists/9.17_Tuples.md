Tuples are collections of data that are ordered and unchangeable.
You can think of a tuple as a `List` with a fixed size.
Tuples are created with round brackets:

``` python
my_tuple = ('this is a tuple', 45, True)
print(my_tuple[0])
# this is a tuple
print(my_tuple[1])
# 45
print(my_tuple[2])
# True
```

While it's typically considered bad practice to store items of different types in lists.
It's not a problem with Tuples.
Because they have fixed size, it's easy to keep track of which indexes store which typedata.

Tuples are often used to store very small groups of data.
For example, you might use tuple to store a dog's name and age.

``` python
dog = ('Fido', 4)
```

Note: Must include a comma, so python knows it's Tuple and not Parentheses.

Because Tuples hold their data, multiple tuples can be stored within a list.
When accessing list of tuples, 
- First index selects tuple u wanna access,
- Second index selects item u wanna access inside the tuple.

``` python
my_tuples = [("1st tuple", 45, True),("2nd tuple", 21, False)]
print(my_tuples[0][0]) # 1st tuple
print(my_tuples[0][1]) # 45
print(my_tuples[1][0]) # 2nd tuple
print(my_tuples[1][2]) # False
```

When u return multiple values from a func u actually returning a tuple.
