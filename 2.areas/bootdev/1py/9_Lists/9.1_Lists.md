A natural way to organize and store data is in a `List`.
Some languages call them 'arrays'.
Think of all the apps u use and how many of the items in thhe app are orged into lists.
- Twitter is a list of posts
- An online store is a list of products
- the state of a chess game is a list of moves
- this list is a list of things that are lists.

Lists in python are declared using square brackets, with commas separating each item.
``` python
inventory = ['Iron Breastplate', 'healing Potion', 'Leather scraps']
```

Lists can contain items of any data type, in our example above we have a list of strings

When we're manually creating lists it can be easier to declare the list using multiple lines.
``` python
flower_types = [
    "daffodil",
    "rose",
    "chrysanthemum"
]

player_ages = [
    23,
    18,
    31,
    42
]
```
