The length of a list can be calculated using the `len()` functio.

``` python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "pear"]
length = len(fruits)
# 3
```

The length of the list is equal to the number of items present.
Don't be fooled by the fact that the length is not equal to the index of the last element,
in fact, it will always be one greater.
