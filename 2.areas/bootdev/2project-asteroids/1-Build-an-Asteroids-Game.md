We're going to build a simple video game, 
based on the classic Asteroids.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.10+ installed
Unix-Like Shell

### Learning Goals
1. Introduce multi-file Python projects
2. Show real-world use case for OOP

The goal is not to teach game development or the math required for physics simulations.
As a result, there are some places where you will simply copy-paste code that we wrote for you. 
Don't worry about trying to understand every detail if it's not interesting to you,
you will be asked to write the parts that matter the most.

### Assignment
Make sure you have the Boot.Dev CLI installed and working.
