## Book Class

Set `.title` and `.author` to the values of the parameters

## Library Class

Add the following methods
Initialize a `.name` member variable to the value of the `name` parameter. 
Create a `.books` member initialized to empty list.

``` python
class Book:
	def __init__(self, title, author):
		self.title = title
		self.author = author

class Library:
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name
		self.books = []

	def add_book(self, book):
		self.books.append(book)

	def remove_book(self, book):
		for lib_book in self.books:
			if book.title == lib_book.title and book.author == lib_book.author:
				self.books.remove(lib_book)

	def search_books(self, search_string):
		results = []
		for book in self.books:
			if (
				search_string.lower() in book.title.lower()
				and search_string.lower() in book.author.lower()
			):
				results.append(book)
		return results
```

Observations: 
- methods in a class can access each other in a way that a regular function script can't
	- for example `search_books` method can access `self.books` list from `__init__` method
- any changes you make to an instance (`self`) persist after method finishes executing
	- for example `add_book` method might nor return nothing but it modifies `self.books` list
