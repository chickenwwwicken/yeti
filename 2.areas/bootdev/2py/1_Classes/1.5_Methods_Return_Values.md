If normal function doesn't return anything, 
it's typically not a very useful function.

In contrast, 
methods often don't return anything because they can mutate properties of object.

However they can return values if you want
They just functions with access to object in the end.

### Method returns Value 1

``` python
class Soldier:
    armor = 2
    num_weapons = 2

    def get_speed(self):
        speed = 10
        speed -= self.armor
        speed -= self.num_weapons
        return speed

soldier_one = Soldier()
print(soldier_one.get_speed())
# prints "6"
```

### Method Returns Value 2

``` python
class Wall:
    armor = 10
    height = 5

    def get_cost(self):
        return self.armor * self.height

wall_1 = Wall()
print(wall_1.get_cost())
```
