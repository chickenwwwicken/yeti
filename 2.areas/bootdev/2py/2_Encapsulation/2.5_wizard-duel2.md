Complete the `cast_fireball` and `__is_alive` methods.

#### `cast_fireball`
If there isn't enough mana to cast a fireball (see `fireball_cost`), 
`raise` an `Exception` with the message `___ cannot cast fireball` 
where `___` is the wizard's name.

If the wizard has enough mana, reduce their mana by the `fireball_cost` 
and make sure to call `get_fireballed` on the target wizard or they'll be stuck endless battle.

#### `__is_alive` 
This method should return `True` if the wizard's health is greater than 0,
and `False` otherwise.

``` python
fireball_damage = 500
potion_mana = 100
fireball_cost = 50


class Wizard:
	def __init__(self, name, stamina, intelligence):
		self.name = name
		self.__stamina = stamina
		self.__intelligence = intelligence
		self.mana = self.__intelligence * 10
		self.health = self.__stamina * 100

	def cast_fireball(self,target):
		if self.mana < fireball_cost:
			raise Exception(f"{self.name} cannot cast fireball")
		self.mana -= fireball_cost
		target.get_fireballed()

	def __is_alive(self):
		return self.health > 0

	def get_fireballed(self):
		self.health -= fireball_damage

	def drink_mana_potion(self):
		self.mana += potion_mana
```
