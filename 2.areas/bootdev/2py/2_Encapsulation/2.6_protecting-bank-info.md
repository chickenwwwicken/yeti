Age of Dragons is a game about resource management and strategy.
The game has a feature that allows players to manage their resources in a bank.
The bank has a feature that allows players to deposit and withdraw funds. 

#### Assignment
Complete the `BankAccount` class.

##### Constructor
Initialize private instance variables `__account_number` to `account_number`,
and `__balance` to `initial_balance`.

##### Public Getters
Define getter methods `get_account_number` and `get_balance` that return the values of the private variables.

##### `deposit` method
Should accept an `amount` as input and add it to the account `balance` .

If the deposit amount isn't positive, it should `raise` a `ValueError` exception with the message:
`Cannot deposit zero or negative funds` .
Otherwise, it should add the amount to the balance.

##### `withdraw` method
It should accept an `amount` and check if there is enough money in the account for the withdrawal.

If the withdrawal amount isn't positive, it should `raise` a `ValueError` exception with the message
`Cannot withdraw zero or negative funds`. 
Then, if there are not enough funds it should `raise` a `Value Error` exception withh the message
`Insufficient funds` . 
Otherwise, it should deduct the `amount` from the balance

``` python
class BankAccount:
	def __init__(self, account_number, initial_balance):
		self.__account_number = account_number
		self.__balance = initial_balance

	def get_account_number(self):
		return self.__account_number

	def get_balance(self):
		return self.__balance

	def deposit(self, amount):
		if amount < 1:
			raise ValueError("Cannot deposit zero or negative funds")
		self.__balance += amount

	def withdraw(self, amount):
		if amount < 1:
			raise ValueError("Cannot withdraw zero or negative funds")
		if amount > self.__balance:
			raise ValueError("Insufficient Funds")
		self.balance -= amount
```
