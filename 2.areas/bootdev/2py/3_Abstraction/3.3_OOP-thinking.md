Classes in object-oriented programming are all about grouping data and behavior together
in one place: an object.

Object oriented programmers tend to think about programming as a modeling problem.
They think:

```
Hoow can i write a Human class that holds the data and simulates the behavior of a real human?
```

In contrast, functional programmers tend to think of their code as inputs and outputs,
and how those inputs and outputs transition the world from one state to the next:

``` 
when a human takes a step, what's the new state of the game?
```
