We've made it to the holy grail of OOP

Non-oop languages like Go and Rust allow for encapsulation and abstraction features
as nearly every language does. 
Inheritance, on the other hand, tends to unique to class-based languages like Python, Java, Ruby.

### What is Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class, the "child" class, to inherit the properties and methods of another clss.
the "parent" class.

This powerful language feature helps us avoid writing a lot of the code twice. 
It allows us to Don't Repeat Yourself up our code. 

### Syntax 
Here `Cow` is a "Child" class that inherits from the "parent" class `Animal`:

``` python
class Animal:
    # parent "Animal" class

class Cow(Animal):
    # child class "Cow" inherits "Animal"
```

The `Cow` class can reuse the `Animal` class's constructor with the `super()` method

``` python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, num_legs):
        self.num_legs = num_legs

class Cow(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
        # call the parent constructor to
        # give the cow some legs
        super().__init__(4)
```

### Assignment
In Age of dragons, all the archers are humans, 
but not all humans are necessarily archers. 
All humans have a `name` ,
but only archers have a `__num_arrows` property.

Complete the `Archer` class. 
It should inherit the `Human` class.
In its constructor it should call its parent's constructor, 
then also set its unique `__num_arrows` property. 

``` python
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name


## don't touch above this line


class Archer(Human):
    def __init__(self, name, num_arrows):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.__num_arrows = num_arrows

    def get_num_arrows(self):
        return self.__num_arrows
```

### When to use Inheritance?

It is a really bad idea to try to overuse it. 
Inheritance should only be used when all instances of a child class are also instances of the parent class. 
Wwhen a child class inherits from a parent, it inherits everything. 
If you only want to share some functionality, inheritance is probably not the best answer.  
Better to simply share some functions, 
or maybe make a new parent class that both classes can inherit from. 

All cats are animals but not all animals are cats.
