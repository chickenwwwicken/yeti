You likely won't see an inheritance tree with a base class of `organis` leading through a chain of 4 subclasses to `cat`. If you do: run

#### Why are inheritance trees often wide instead of deep.
In good software a child class is a strict subset of its parent class.
In a deep tree, 
that means the children need to be perfect members of all the parent class "types".
That simply doesn't happen very often in the real world. 
It's much more likely that you'll have a base class that simply has many sibling classes that are slightly different variations of the base.
