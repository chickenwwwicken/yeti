Polymorphism in programming is the ability to present the same interface (function or method signatures) for many different underlying forms (data types)

Polymorphism in programming is the ability to present the same function for many different underlying data types

A classic example is a `Shape` class that `Rectangle` `Circle` , and `Triangle` can inherit from. With poly, each of these classes will have different underlying data. 
The circle needs its center point coordinates and radius. The rectangle needs two coordinates for the top left and bottom right corners. The triangle needs coordinates for the corners. 

By making each class responsible for its data and its code,
you can achieve polymorphism. 
In the shapes example, each class would have its own `draw_shape()` method. 
This allows the code that uses the different shapes to be simple and easy, and more importantly, it can treat shapes as the same even though they are different. It hides the complexities of the difference behind a clean abstraction. 

``` python
shapes = [Circle(5, 5, 10), Rectangle(1, 3, 5, 6)]
for shape in shapes:
    print(shape.draw_shape())
```

This is in contrast to the functional way of doing things where you would have had separate functions that have different function signatures, like:
`draw_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and `draw_circle(x, y, radius)`

### What is function signature?
A function signature (or method signature) includes the name, inputs, and outputs of a function or method. For example, `hit_by_fire` in the `Human` and `Archer` classes have identical signatures.

``` python
class Human:
    def hit_by_fire(self):
        self.health -= 5
        return self.health

class Archer:
    def hit_by_fire(self):
        self.health -= 10
        return self.health
```

Both methods have the same name, take `0` inputs, and return integers. 
If any of those things were different, they would have different function signatures.

Here are some different signatures:

``` python 
class Human:
    def hit_by_fire(self):
        self.health -= 5
        return self.health

class Archer:
    def hit_by_fire(self, dmg):
        self.health -= dmg
        return self.health
```

just taking the `dmg` as a parameter makes this a different signature. 


Calling two methods with the same signature should look the same to the caller:

``` python
# same inputs (none)
# same name
# same outputs (a single integer)
health = sam.hit_by_fire()
health = archer.hit_by_fire()
```

### If you Override: use the same function sig
If you change the function signature of a parent class when overriding a method, it could be a disaster. The whole point of overriding a method is so that the caller of your code doesn't have to worry about what different things are going on inside the methods of different object types.
