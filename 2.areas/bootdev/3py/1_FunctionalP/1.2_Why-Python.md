Python is not the best language for functional programming.
Reasons:

1. no static typing
2. Everything is mutable
3. No tail call optimization
4. side effects are common
5. imperative and oop styles abound in popular libraries.
6. purity is not enforced and sometimes not even encouraged.
7. sum types are hard to define
8. pattern matching is weak at best.

We already know python so we gonna keep at it cuz.
Python is a great choice for learning code basics, 
OOP, Algorithms, and Data Structures, 
and the tradeoff of learning a new language at this point in the curriculum not worthit.

We can still cover the most important concepts of functional programming in Python, even if we have to jump through hoop or two to do it. 

Functional programming is a paradigm of useful techniques for writing better code, 
and they apply to all languages, nut just purely functional ones.
