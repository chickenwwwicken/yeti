I run into new devs, who after learning about classes, 
wanna use them everywhere. 
They assume that because they learned about functions first, 
functions are somehow inferior. 

NOPE

### Should I use funcs of Classes?

If you're unsure, default to functions. 
I find myself reaching for classes when I need something long-lived and stateful that would be easier to model if I could share behavior and data structure via inheritance. 
This is often the case for :
- video games
- simulations
- GUIs

The difference is: 

```
Classes encourage you to think about the world as a hierarchical collection of objects.
Objects bundle behavior, data, and state together in a way that draws boundaries between
instancess of things, like chess pieces on a board.
```

``` 
Functions encourage you to think about the world as a series of data transformations. 
Functions take data as input and return a transformed output.
For example, a function might take the entire state of a chess board and a move as inputs,
and return the new state of the board as output. 
```

Use what feels right to you in your projects,
and adjust and refactor as you improve your skills.
