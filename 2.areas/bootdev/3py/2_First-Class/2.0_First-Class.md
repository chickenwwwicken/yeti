## Functions as Values

In Python, functions are just values, like strings, or objects.
For example, we can assign an existing function to a variable:

``` python
def add(x, y):
	return x + y

# assign the function to a new variable
# called "addition". It behaves the same
# as the original "add" function

addiiton = add

print(addition(2, 5))
# 7
```

### Assignment 
With the popularity of gen AI, 
we need to be able to convert files into pure text to be injected into prompts.

Complete the `file_to_prompt` function. 
It should take a `file` dictionary and a `to_string` function is responsible for converting the file dictionary into a string: 
you don't need to implement it, it's a value passed to your function. 

However, your function should wrap the result of the `to_string` function in triple backticks to format it as a code block in Markdown. 

For example: 

an example string

should become: 

```
an example string
```

## Converting Dict to backtick block w titles

``` python
# dictionary
{
    "filename": "essay.txt",
    "content": "Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong...",
    "author_first_name": "Brian",
    "author_last_name": "Johnson",
},

# function for organizing "file"
def to_string(file):
    return (
        f"File: {file['filename']}\n"
        f"Author: {file['author_first_name']} {file['author_last_name']}\n"
        f"Content: {file['content']}"
    )

# converting it to a backtick block
def file_to_prompt(file, to_string):
    return f"```\n{to_string(file)}\n```"
```

Result:

```
File: essay.txt
Author: Brian Johnson
Content: Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong...
```
