The built-in filter function takes a function and an iterable (in this case a list) and returns a new iterable that only contains elements from the original iterable where the result of the function on that item returned `True`.

## Filter in Python

``` python
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
evens = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
print(evens)
# [2, 4, 6]
```

### Assingment
Complete the `remove_invalid_lines` function. 
It accepts documents as input. It should:

1. use the built-in `filter` function and a lambda to return a copy of the input document.
2. Remove any lines that start with a `-` character.
3. Keep all the other lines and preserve trailing newlines.

For example, this:

```
* Star Wars episode 1 is underrated
- Star Wars episode 9 is fine
* Star Wars episode 3 is the best
```

should become:

```
* Star Wars episode 1 is underrated
* Star Wars episode 3 is the best
```

TIPS:

``` python
"\n".join(["a", "b", "c"])
# a
# b
# c
```


``` python
s = "hello"
s.startswith("h")
# True
s.startswith("o")
# False
```


``` python
s = """hello
world"""
lines = s.split("\n")
# ['hello', 'world']
```


### Clean up lines with `filter` + `lambda`

``` python
def remove_invalid_lines(document):
	return "\n".join(filter(lambda line: not line.startswith("-"), document.split("\n")))
```

Instead of `for loops` , `filter` function can go throughh iterables like lists... so what we doin is this:

1. we split the document input (`document.split("\n")`) and add it as the iterable
2. `lambda` serves as the function input for `filter`
	1. iterable `line` from `document` checks for `not line.startswith("-")`
	2. `filter` automatically returns a new iterable withh only items that return `True` from func.
3. we join the new iterable from the `filter` with `"\n".join()`.
