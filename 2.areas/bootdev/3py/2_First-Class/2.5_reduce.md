The built-in `functools.reduce()` function takes a function and a list of values, 
and applies the function to each value in the list, 
accumulating a single result as it goes.

``` python
# import functools from thhe standard library
import functools

def add(sum_so_far, x):
	print(f"sum_so_far: {sum_so_far}, x: {x}")
	return sum_so_far + x

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sum = functools.reduce(add, numbers)
# sum_so_far: 1, x: 2
# sum_so_far: 3, x: 3
# sum_so_far: 6, x: 4
# 10 doesn't print, it's just thhe final result

print(sum)
# 10
```


### Assignment
Complete the `join` and the `join_first_sentences` functions.

#### `join()`
This is a helper function we'll use in `join_first_sentences`. 
It takes two inputs:
- A "doc_so_far" accumulator string. It's similar to the `sum_so_far` variable in the example above.
- A `sentence` string. This is the next string we wanna add to the accumulator.

It returns the result of concatenating the "doc" and "sentence" strings together,
with a period and a space in between. For example:

``` python
doc = "This is the first sentence"
sentence = "This is the second sentence"
print(join(doc, sentence))
# This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence
```

#### `join_first_sentences()`
It accepts two arguments:
- A list of sentence strings
- An integer `n`

It should use the built-in `functools.reduce()` function alongside your `join` function to return a single string: 
the result of joining thhe first `n` sentences in the list.
It should also add a final period (but no trailing space) to the end of thhe final "reduced" string.

If `n` is zero, just return an empty string.

Use list slicing to get the first `n` sentences. For example:

``` python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print(fruits[:2])
# ["apple", "banana"]
```

Example of expected behavior:

``` python
joined = join_first_sentences(
    ["This is the first sentence", "This is the second sentence", "This is the third sentence"],
    2
)
print(joined)
# This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.
```


### Solution

## Using `functools.reduce()` to cat `n` strings

``` python
import functools

def join(doc_so_far, sentence):
	return doc_so_far + ". " + sentence

def join_first_sentences(sentences, n):
	if n == 0:
		return ""
	return functools.reduce(join, sentences[:n]) + "."
```

- `join()` just cats `doc_so_far` with `sentence` with a `. ` in between
- `n` is the amount of strings we want to be cating from all the sentences in this case
	- `n` = 3 = we want 3 sentences added, no more
- `functools.reduce(join, sentences[:n])` 
	- uses `join()` function 
	- uses slicing to delimit amount of sentences we want.
	- we add a `.` at the end cuz there are no dots in the strings (sentences).
