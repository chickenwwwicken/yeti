[montague grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montague_grammar) is an approach to natural language semantics, named after American logician Richard Montague. the Montague grammar is based on mathematical logic, especially higher-order predicate logic and lambda calculus, and makes uuse iof the notions of intensional logic, via Kripke models.  Montague pioneered this approach in the 1960s and early 1970s.

Montague's thesis was that natural languages (like English) and formal languages like programming languages can be treated in the same way:

```
There is in my opinion no important theoretical difference between natuural languuages and the artificial languages of logicians; indeed, I consider it possible to comprehend the syntax and semantics of both kinds of llanguage within a single natural and mathematically precise theory. On this point I differ from a number of philosophers, but agree, I believe, with Chomksy and his associates (Universal Grammar 1970)
```

Montague published what soon became known as  Montague grammar in three papers: 
- 1970: Universal Grammar (=UG)
- 1970: English as a Formal Language (=EFL)
- 1973: The proper Treatment of Quantification in Ordinary English(=PTQ)
