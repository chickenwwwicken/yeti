In computer science [tree reversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal) (also known as tree search and walking the tree) is a form of graph traversal and refers to the process of visiting(e.g. retrieving, updating, or deleting) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited. The following algorithms are described for a binary tree, but they may be generalized to other trees as well.

unlike linked lists, one-dimensional arrays and other linear data structures, which are canonically traversed in linear order, trees may be traversed in muyltiple ways. They may be traversed in depth-first of breadth-first order. There are three common ways to traverse them in depth-first order: in-order, pre-order, and post-order. Beyond these basic traversals. various more complex or hybrid schemes are possible, such as depth-limited searches like iterative deepening depth-first search. The latter, as well as breadth-first search, can also be used to traverse infinite trees,
