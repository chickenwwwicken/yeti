Pure functions have a lot of benefits. 
Whenever possible, good devs try to use pure functions instead of impure functions.
Remembeer, pure functions:

- Return the same value if given the same arguments. They are [[deterministic]].
- Do not change the external state of the program. For example, they do not change any variables outside of their scope.
- Do not perform any I/O operations (like reading from disk, accessing the internet, or writing from the console).

These properties result in pure functions being easier to test, debug, and think about. 

Refer to the following examples and answer the question. 

#### Example 1

``` python
def multiply_by2(nums):
    products = []
    for num in nums:
        products.append(num*2)
    return products
# pure
```

#### Example 2

``` python
balance = 1000
cars = []

def buy_car(new_car):
    cars.append(new_car)
    balance -= 69
# impure
```

#### Example 3

``` python
import random

def roll_die(num_sides):
    return random.randint(1, num_sides)
# impure
```
