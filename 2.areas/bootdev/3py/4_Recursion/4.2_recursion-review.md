I hate explaining jokes, but in case you don't get the comic: The joke is that the characters within the Dungeons and Dragons game are also playing their own Dungeons and Dragons game. Maybe their character's game of DnD also has characters playing DnD, and so on, recursively forever.

### Another Example

``` python
def print_chars(word, i):
	if i == len(word):
		return
	print(word[i])
	print_chars(word, i + 1)

print_chars('Hello', 0)
# H
# e
# l
# l
# o
```
#
Answers:
What happens if a recursive function has no base case:
- It will keep calling itself forever, resulting in an infinite loop.

What is printed if I call `print_chars('elephant', 3)`
- phant
