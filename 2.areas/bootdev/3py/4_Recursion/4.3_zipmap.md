Let's pracitce another simple recursive funciton. 

You may not understand recursion just yet, but by following the instructions, you will begin to grasp the fundamentals. 

### Assignment
Within Doc2Doc we need to map certain properties from one document to properties of another document. Complete the recursive `zipmap` function. 

It takes two lists as input and returns a dictionary where the first list provides the keys and the second list provides the values. 

Example usage:

``` python
zipped = zipmap(
    ["Avatar: The Last Airbender", "Avatar (in Papyrus font)", "The Last Airbender (Live Action)"],
    [9.9, 6.1, 2.1]
)

print(zipped)
# {
#   'Avatar: The Last Airbender': 9.9,
#   'Avatar (in Papyrus font)': 6.1,
#   'The Last Airbender (Live Action)': 2.1,
# }
```

Here's the pseudocode: 

1. If either the `keys` or `values` list is empty, return an empty dictionary (base case)
2. Recursively call `zipmap` on all but the first elements from `keys` and `values`
3. Add the first element of `keys` to the resulting dict, and set its values to the first element in `values`
4. Return the updated dictionary.

### Adding two lists to create a dictionary with Recursive

``` python
def zipmap(keys, values):
    dict = {}
    if len(keys) == 0 or len(values) == 0:
        return dict

    rest_dict = zipmap(keys[1:], values[1:])
    rest_dict[keys[0]] = values[0]

    return rest_dict
```

`zipmap()` can be called, even when being assigned to a value...
