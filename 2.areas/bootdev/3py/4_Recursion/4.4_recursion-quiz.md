Consider the following function:

``` python
def countdown(n):
    print(n)
    if n == 0:
        return
    else:
        countdown(n - 1)
```

Which line contains the base case?
- if n == 0

Which line contains the recursive call?
- countdown(n - 1)

What would happen if we swapped `coundown(n - 1)` with `countdown(n)` for n > 0
- An infinite recursive loop.
