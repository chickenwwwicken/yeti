, Recursion is often used in tree-like structures. For example:
- Nested Dictionaries
- File systems
- HTML documents
- JSON objects

That's because trees can have unkown depth. 
It's hard to write a series of loops because you don't know how many levels deep the tree goes. 

``` python
for entry_i in directory:
    if entry_i.is_dir:
        for entry_j in entry_i:
            if entry_j.is_dir
                for entry_k in entry_j:
                    ...
```

### Assignment
You're responsible for a module in Doc2Doc that can scan a file system (represented in our code as nested dictionaries) and create a list of the filenames. 

Complete the recursive `list_files` function.
It accepts two arguments:
- `current_filetree` (dict): A dictionary representing the file system
- `current_path` (str): A string representing the current path -> `root/dir1/dir2`

It should return a list of file paths (strings).
For example, this filetree:

``` python
{
    "Documents": {
        "Proposal.docx": None,
        "Receipts": {
            "January": {
                "receipt1.txt": None,
                "receipt2.txt": None
            },
            "February": {
                "receipt3.txt": None
            }
        }
    },
}
```

Should result in the following list of file paths:

``` python
[
    "/Documents/Proposal.docx",
    "/Documents/Receipts/January/receipt1.txt",
    "/Documents/Receipts/January/receipt2.txt",
    "/Documents/Receipts/February/receipt3.txt"
]
```

### Steps
1. Create an empty list to store the file paths. 
2. For each 'node' in the current dictionary (just use a loop):
	1. If the node's entry is `None` (meaning it's a final file, not a dir), `append` the full path for that node to the list. 
	2. Otherwise, extend the file list with the results of a recursive `list_files` call.
		1. The new `current_filetree` for the recursive call is the one nested under the current node. 
		2. The new `current_path` should be the old one with the new node's name added after a slash -> `old_current_path/node_name`.
3. Return the list of file paths. 

#### Tips
What's the base case? It looks a bit different than before, but it's just when a nessted node's value is `None` because in that case we don't have any more directories to explore. 

You might be wondering why we used a loop! Loops are nice when we know how many times we need to iterate (the number of keys in the dictionary). Recursion is nice when we don't know how many times we need to iterate (the number of nested dictionaries).

### Recursive Explorer of a File System (Dictionaries)
Recursive Explorer of Dictionaries + adding values (paths) to a list.

``` python
def list_files(current_filetree, current_path=""):
    file_paths = []
    for node in current_filetree:
        if current_filetree[node] == None:
            file_paths.append('/'.join([current_path, node]))
        else:
            file_paths.extend(list_files(current_filetree[node], current_path + '/' + node))
    return file_paths
```

How this works:
1. Initial Call: When you first call `list_files`, `current_path` is initialized as an empty string `""`.

2. Path Construction: As you traverse each node (using your loop), if it's a directory (a dictionary), the `current_path` is updated to include the name of the node. This is achieved by concatenating the current `node` to `current_path` with a slash (`'/'`).

3. Recursive Update: Each recursive call receives its own version of `current_path`. When you call `list_files(current_filetree[node], current_path + '/' + node)`, you're passing an updated version of the path down the recursion for that specific subdirectory.

4. Path Preservation: As the recursion unwinds, each level retains and returns the `file_paths` list constructed with its own `current_path`, effectively remembering the full path to each file as the recursion resolves.

So, `current_path` is continually updated and carried through each recursive call, building the full path step-by-step as the function navigates the nested dictionaries.
