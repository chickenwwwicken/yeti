Doc2Doc has a spellchecker, but users ooften use slang words that aren't recognized. 
Create a feature to allow users too add their own words to the spellchecker. 

### Assignment
Complete the 'user_words' function. 
It accepts a tuple of `initial_words` as input and returns a function, `add_word`.
Since tuples are immutable, you don't need to worry about modifying the `initial_words`.
`add_word` should add a new `word` string to the words and return all words as a tuple. 

tuples can be concatenated with `+`

in first try we don't need nonlocal because we were modifying a list object using `append()` which modifies the list in place. But for reassigning the variable (like with tuple concatenation), we do need `nonlocal`.

### Adding words to a tuple
##### first try
``` python
def user_words(initial_words):
    list_words = list(initial_words)
    def add_word(word):
	    list_words.append(word)
	    return tuple(list_words)
	return add_word
```
##### boot.dev solution
``` python
def user_words(initial_words):
	words = initial_words
	def add_word(word):
		nonlocal words
		words = words + (word,)
		return words
	return add_word
```
