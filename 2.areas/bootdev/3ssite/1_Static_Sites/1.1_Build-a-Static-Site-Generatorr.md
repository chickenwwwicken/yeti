Let's build a static site generator from scratch!
A static site generator takes raw content files (like .md and .jpeg)
and turns them into a static website (a mix of HTML and CSS files).

Static sites are very popular for blogs and other content-heavy websites because they're fast, secure and easy to host. 

Boot.dev Blog is a production-level static site generated with Hugo. 

### Static vs. Dynamice
A static site the content is always the same: 
Users can not:
- Upload files
- Log in
- Leave comments
- Save preferences.

You would need a dynamic site for that stuff, 
which is usually powered by a database and a custom web server. 
Static sites are great for:
- Blogs
- Portfolios
- Landing Pages
- Documentation

### Assignment
We'll be using the boot.dev CLI to run and submit the tests for some of the lessons in this project, 
make sure you have it installed .
