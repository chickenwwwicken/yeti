Writing HTML by hand sucks. Even if you're a grubby front-end programmer, you probably don't want to write entire documents in raw HTML.

Writing Markdown is pure bliss. Markdown is a less-verbose markup language designed for ease of writing. The trouble is web browsers don't understand Markdown. They only understand HTML and CSS. The #1 job of a static site generator is to convert Markdown into HTML

Instead of writing a verbose HTML list:
``` html
<ul>
    <li>I really</li>
    <li>hate writing</li>
    <li>in raw html</li>
</ul>
```
We can write this in Markdown:
``` md
* I really
* hate writing 
* in raw HTML
```
Our static site generator will take a directory of markdown files (one for each web page), 
and build a directory of HTML files. 
Because we're not savages, we'll also include a single CSS file to style the site.
