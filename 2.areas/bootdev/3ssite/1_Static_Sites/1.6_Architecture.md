We'll dive into code in the next chapter, but first,
I want to give a high-level architecture for our static site generator. 

![[Pasted image 20250122100645.png]]

The flow of data through the full system is:
1. Md files are in the `/content` directort. A `template.html` file is inn the root of the project.
2. The static sitte generator (python code in `src/`) reads the markdown files and template file. 
3. The generator converts the markdown files to a final HTML file for each page and writes them to the `/public` directory.
4. We start the built-in python http server (a separate program, unrelated to the generator) to serve the contents of the `/public` directory on `http://localhost:8888` (our local machine).
5. We open a browser to navigate to `hhtp://localhost:8888` to view the rendered site. 

### How the SSG works
The vat majority of our coding will happen in the `src/` directory because almost all of the work is done in steps 2 and 3 above. Here's a roough outline of what the final program will do when it runs: 

1. Delete everything in the `/public` directory. 
2. Copy any static assets (HTML template, images, CSS, etc.) to the `/public` dir. 
3. Generate an HTML file for each md file in the `/content` dir. For each md file: 
	1. Open the file and read its contents.
	2. Split the markdown intoo 'blocks' 
	3. convert each block into a tree of `HTMLNode` objects. for inline elements (like bold, text, links, etc.) we will convert
		- raw markdown -> textnode -> HTMLNode
	4. Join all the `HTMLNode` blocks under one large parent `HTMLNode` and all its nested nodes to a giant HTML string and inject it in the HTML template. 
	5. Use a recursive `to_html()` method to convert the `HTMLNode` and all its nested nodes to a giant HTML string and inject it in the HTML template.
	6. Write the full HTML string to a file for that page in the `/public` directory. 

### How We're Gonna build It.
We're not going to build the program in the same order that it runs.. .that's often not the  best way to build large projects. Instead, we'll tackle individual problems that we know we'll need to solve and use unit tests to make sure they work as expected. 

We'll put the pieces together into a working program as we get close to the end. 

You don't need to memorize the information on this page, but come back to review it if you ever feel lost in the details.
