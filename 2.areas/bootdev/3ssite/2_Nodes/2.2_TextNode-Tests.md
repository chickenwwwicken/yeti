Unit tests are a way to verify that the code you write works as expected. 
In other Boot.dev courses, you write code that passes the unit tests we provide. 
As a developer, you'll be expected to write your own tests to ensure that individual pieces of your code, 
"units", work as expected.

It can feel like a lot of extra work...

...but it's often worth it, especially if the logic you're testing is particularly complex while simultaneously easy to test (e.g. it doesn't rely on external stuff like files or the network). 
Once you have some good tests, you can run them whenever you make changes to ensure you didn't break anything.

### Assignment
1. Crreate a new script in the root of the project called `test.sh`.
This will be a convenient way to run our tests. It should contain:
``` 
python3 -m unittest discover -s src
```
This command tells python to use the standard library's `unittest` module to run all the tests (`discover`) it can find in the `src` directory. 

2. Create a `test_textnode.py` file in the `src` directory. This is where we'll write our tests for the `TextNode` class. Here's a file with a single test:
``` python
import unittest

from textnode import TextNode, TextType


class TestTextNode(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_eq(self):
        node = TextNode("This is a text node", TextType.BOLD)
        node2 = TextNode("This is a text node", TextType.BOLD)
        self.assertEqual(node, node2)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

This test creates two `TextNode` objects with the same properties and asserts that they are equal. Notice the missing `url` argument which should have a default value of `None`. If you run your tests with `./test.sh`, you should see that the test passes.

3. Add some test cases by adding methods to the `TestTextNode` class to verify that the `TextNode` class works as expected. You can use the following methods to compare the objects:
	- `self.assertEqual` - if the inputs are equal the test passes
	- `self.assertNotEqual` - if the inputs are not equal the test passes

4. Add even more test cases (at least 3 in total) to check various edge cases, like when the `url` property is `None`, or when the `text_type` property is different. You'll want to make sure that when properties are different, the `TextNode` objects are not equal.
5. When you're satisfied that your class is behaving as expected, move on
Note: Both test functions and file names must start with `test_` to be discoverable by `unittest`
