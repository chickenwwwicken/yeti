Time to render some HTML strings!

A `LeafNode` is a type of `HTMLNode` that represents a single HTML tag with no children.
For example, a simple `<p>` tag with some text inside of it:
``` html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```
We call it a leaf bode because it's a leaf in the tree of HTML nodes. 
It's a node with no children. 
In this example, `<p>` is not a leaf node, but `<b>` is:
``` html
<p>This is a paragraph. <b>This is bold text.</b> This is the last sentence</p>
```

### Assignment
1. Create a child class of `HTMLNode` called `LeafNode`.
	1. It's constructor should differ slightly from the `HTMLNode` class because:
		- it should not allow for any children.
		- The `value` data member should be required (and `tag` even though the tag's value may be `None`)
Use the [super()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/222877/what-does-super-do-in-python-difference-between-super-init-and-expl) function to call the constructoor of the `HTMLNode` class.
2. Add a `.to_html()` method that renders a leaf node as an HTML string (bu returning a str)
	- if the leaf node has no `value ` , it should raise a ValueErrrorr. All leaf nodes must have a value. 
	- If there is no `tag` (it's `None`), the `value` should be returned as raw text.
	- Otherwise, it should render and HTML tag. For example, these leaf nodes:
``` python
LeafNode("p", "This is a paragraph of text.")
LeafNode("a", "Click me!", {"href": "https://www.google.com"})
```
Should render as:
``` html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<a href="https://www.google.com">Click me!</a>
```
3. add some tests.
4. Once happpy with ev, run and submit from root of project.
