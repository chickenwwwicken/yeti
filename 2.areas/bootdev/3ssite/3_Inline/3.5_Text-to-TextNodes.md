Time to put all the "splitting" functions together into a function that can convert a raw string of markdown-flavored text into a list of `TextNode` objects.

### Assignment
Create a `text_to_textnodes(text)` function. Here's some example input:
``` python
This is **text** with an *italic* word and a `code block` and an ![obi wan image](https://i.imgur.com/fJRm4Vk.jpeg) and a [link](https://boot.dev)
```
It should output this list of nodes: 
``` python
[
    TextNode("This is ", TextType.TEXT),
    TextNode("text", TextType.BOLD),
    TextNode(" with an ", TextType.TEXT),
    TextNode("italic", TextType.ITALIC),
    TextNode(" word and a ", TextType.TEXT),
    TextNode("code block", TextType.CODE),
    TextNode(" and an ", TextType.TEXT),
    TextNode("obi wan image", TextType.IMAGE, "https://i.imgur.com/fJRm4Vk.jpeg"),
    TextNode(" and a ", TextType.TEXT),
    TextNode("link", TextType.LINK, "https://boot.dev"),
]
```
This function should be simple now that you've done all the hard work, 
use all your splitting functions one after the other. 

2. Write a bunch of tests
3. Run and submit the tests from the root of the project.
