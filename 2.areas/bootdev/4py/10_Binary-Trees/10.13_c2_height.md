Our DevOps team has been concerned with the hardware required to run the software using our BST. In an effort to diagnose the issue, they've asked us to write a method that returns the height of the tree. For example, this tree:
```
    > Elrond#3
> Elian#2
    > Astram#1
```
Has a height of `2` because the longest part from the root node to a leaf node is `2` nodes long. 

### Assignment
Complete the `height` method. It returns the height of the tree rooted at the current node. 

1. If the node's value is `None`, return `0`. 
2. Recursively calculate the height of the left subtree. 
3. Recursively calculate the height of the right subtree. 
4. Use the max() function to return the maximum of the left and right subtree heights plus 1. 

The value is being added always at the bottom cuz "current node" is every node being checked. 

``` python
class BSTNode:
	def height(self):
		if self.val is None:
			return 0

		left_height = 0 
		if self.left is not None:
			left_height = self.left.height()

		right_height = 0 
		if self.right is not None:
			right_height = self.right.height()

		return 1 + max(left_height, right_height)
```
