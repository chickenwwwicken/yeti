Trees aren't particularly useful data structures unless they're ordered in some way. One of the most common types of ordered tree is a Binary Search Tree or `BST`. A `BST` has some additional constraints:

1. Instead of an unbounded list of children, each node has at most 2 children
2. The left child's value must be less than it's parent's value
3. The right child's value must be greater than its parent's value
4. No two nodes in the `BST` can have the same value

By ordering the tree like this, we'll be able to add, remove, find, and update nodes much more quickly.
