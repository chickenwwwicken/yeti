Inserting innto a binary search tree (like most of its operations) is very fast. Picture the algorithm that you just wrote in your head: *how many comparisons does it take to find the right spot for a new node?*

It only requires one comparisonn for each level of the tree, making it `O(log(n))`! (At least in a balanced tree). 

Order `log(n)` is very fast - it's practically as good as `O(1)` in most cases. If our tree has `1,000,000` nnodes, we only need to make `20` ocmparisonns to find the right spot for a new node. If our tree is 2x larger (`2,00,00` nodes), we only need to make one more comparison per insert, `21` in total .
