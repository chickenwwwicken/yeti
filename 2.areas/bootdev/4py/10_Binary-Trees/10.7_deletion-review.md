The `delete` method is `O(log(n))` because, like most B-tree operations, we _don't_ have to search the entire tree. We only have to search _one path_ from the root to the leaf node we want to delete.

The depth of the tree on average is equal to `log base 2` of the number of nodes in the tree. For example:

|Nodes|Depth|
|---|---|
|1|0|
|2|1|
|4|2|
|8|3|
|16|4|
|32|5|
|64|6|
|128|7|
|256|8|
|512|9|
|1024|10|
|2048|11|
|4096|12|

**We only need to use ~10 steps to delete a node from a tree of ~1000 nodes**.
