BST's have a problem. While it's true that on average a `BST` has `O(log(n))` lookups, deletions, and insetions, that fundamental benefit can break down quickly. 

If mostly sorted data, or even worse, completely sorted data, is inserted into a binaary tree, the tree will be much deeper than it is wide. As you know by now, the Big O complexity of the tree's operations depend entirely on the depth of the tree.

### Balanced tree

Notice that both trees are valid BSTs, annd both have the same number of nodes. The trouble is, in the unbalanced tree,theree aer more level to traversee, bringing the Big O complexity closer to `O(n)` than `O(log(n))`. 

#### Questions
If 100 sorted items are inserted into a BST in order, what will be the Big O ccomplexity of lookups?
- O(n)
Assuming the tree remains balanced, will a balanced tree's operation ever degrade past O(log(n))?
- no
