In addition to all thhe rules of a Binary search Tree, a red-black tree must follow some additional ones:
1. Each node is either red or black
2. The root is black. This rule is sometimes omitted. Since the root can always be changed from red to black, but not necessarily vice versa, this rule has little effect on analysis. 
3. All `Nil` leaf nodes are black. 
4. If a node is red, then both its children are black. 
5. All paths from a single node go through the same number of black nodes to reach any of its descendant `NIL` nodes. 
#### Perfectly Balanced?: 
The re-balancing of a red-black tree does not result in a perfectly balanced tree. However, its insertion and deletion operations along with the tree rearrangement and recoloring, are always performed in `O(log(n))` time.
