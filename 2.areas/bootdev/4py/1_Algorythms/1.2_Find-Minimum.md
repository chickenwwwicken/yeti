As mentioned, an "algorithm" is just a set of instuructions that can be carrie3d out to solve a problem . 

It's not anymore magical than that. 

### Assignment
In this course, we'll be building pieces of a social network: LockedIn. LockedIn is a place for professionals to virtue signal about how all the for-profit work they do is actually an altruistic endeavor. Think Facebook meets a job fair. It includes tools for influencers to track their growth. 

Wee need to show our users the accountss they follow with the lowest follower counts. This will help them know who they follow that isn't popular enough to be worth following anymore. 

Implement the "find minimum" algorithm in Python by completing the `find_minimum()` function. It accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the smallest number in the list. 

1. Set `minimum` to positive infinity: `float("inf")`. 
2. If the list is empty, return `None`. 
3. For each number in the list `nums`, compare it to `minimum`. If the number is smaller than `minimum`, set `minimum` to that number. 
4. `minimum` is now set to the smallest number in the list. Return it. 

``` python
def find_minimum(nums):
	minimum = float("inf")
	if not nums: 
		return None
	for num in nums:
		if num < minimum:
			minimum = num
	return minimum
```
