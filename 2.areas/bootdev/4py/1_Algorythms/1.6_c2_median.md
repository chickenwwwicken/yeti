A median is often more useful than an average when the data set contains outliers. For example, if you want to know the typical salary of a software engineer, the median can be a better measure than the average, because the average can be skewed by a few people who make a lot of money. 

At LockedIn, we want to show our influencers the median follower count of the people they follow. 

### Assignment
Complete the `median_followers()` function to find the median follower count of the given list of numbers. 

Order matters - You'll probably want to use the `sorted()` function to help you out. Be sure to appropriately handle lists of even length. 

``` python
def median_followers(nums)
	if not nums: 
		return None

	snums = sorted(nums)
	if len(snums) % 2 == 0:
		return (snums[len(snums) // 2] + snums[(len(snums) - 1) // 2]) / 2
	else: 
		return snums[len(snums) // 2
```
