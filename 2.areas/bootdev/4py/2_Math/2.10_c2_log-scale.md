In some cases, data can span several orders of maagnitude, making it difficult to visualize on a linear scale. A logarithmic scale can help by compressing the data so that it's easier to understand. 

For example, at LockedIn we have influencers with follower counts ranging from 1 to 1,000,000,000. If we want to plot the follower count of each influencer on a graph, it would be difficult to see the differences between the smaller follower counts. We can use a logarithmic scale to compress the data so that it's easier to visualize. 

### Assignment
Write a function `log_scale(data, base)` that takes a list of positive numbers `data`, and a log `base`, and returns a new list with the logarithm of each number in the original list, using the given base. 

You may want to use the `math.log()` function. 

Example: 

``` python
log_scale([1, 10, 100, 1000], 10)
# Output: [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

log_scale([1, 2, 4, 8], 2)
# Output: [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
```


``` python
import math

def log_scale(data, base):
	log_list = []
	for dat in data:
		log_list.append(math.log(dat, base))
	return log_list
```
