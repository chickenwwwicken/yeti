Refer to the following functions, and assume that `first_names` and `last_names` are the same length.

```python
def print_names_one(first_names):
    for first_name in first_names:
        print(first_name)
```

```python
def print_names_two(first_names, last_names):
    for first_name in first_names:
        for last_name in last_names:
            print(first_name, last_name)
```

### Questions
What are the Big O complexities of print_names_one and print_names_two respectively? - O(n), O(n^2)
Which Function will finish faster, assuming `first_names` and `last_names` are the same non-zero length? - print_names_one
