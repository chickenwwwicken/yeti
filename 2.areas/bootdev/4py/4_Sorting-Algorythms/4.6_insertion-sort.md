Insertion sort builds a sorted list one item at a time. It's much less efficient on large lists than merge sort because it's `O(n^2)`, but it's actually faster (not in Big O terms, but due to smaller constants) than merge sort on small lists.

### Assignment
Our influencers want to sort their affiliate deals by revenue. None off our users have more than a couple hundred affiliate deals, so we don't need and `n * log(n)` algorithm like merge sort. In fact, `insertion_sort` can be faster than `merge_sort`, and uses less of our server's memory. 

Complete the `insertion_sort` function according to the given pseudocode:
1. For each index in the input list: 
	1. Set a `j` variable to the current index
	2. While `j` is greater than `0` and the element at index `j-1` is greater than the element at index `j`:
		1. swap the elements at indices `j` and `j-1`
		2. decrement `j` by `1`
2. Return the list

### Tips
In some languages you need to use a `temp` variable to swap values, but in python you can do that in a single line: 
``` python
a = 5  
b = 3 
a, b = b, a
print(a)
# 3
print(b)
# 5
```
``` python
def insertion_sort(nums):
	for i in range(0, len(nums)):
		j = i
		while j > 0 and nums[j-1] > nums[j]:
			nums[j-1], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[j-1]
			j -= 1
	return nums
```
##### Explanation
When we decrement `j` with `j -= 1`, we're essentially moving backward through the already-sorted portion of our list. Let me explain why this is crucial:

Imagine we're midway through sorting `[5, 2, 4, 1, 3]` and have already sorted the first three elements to `[2, 4, 5]`. Now we're processing `1` (at index 3).

1. We start with `j = 3` (the index of `1`)
2. We compare `1` with the previous element `5` and swap them: `[2, 4, 1, 5, 3]`
3. Now `j = 2`, and we compare `1` with `4` and swap again: `[2, 1, 4, 5, 3]`
4. Now `j = 1`, and we compare `1` with `2` and swap again: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]`
5. Now `j = 0`, so we exit the while loop (since `j` is no longer greater than 0)

Without decrementing `j`, we would only compare and possibly swap with the immediate predecessor, not all the previous elements. This would result in a partially sorted list rather than a fully sorted one.
