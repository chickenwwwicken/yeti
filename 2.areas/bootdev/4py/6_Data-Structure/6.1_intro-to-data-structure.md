Starting with this chapter, we're going to focus on how we can store and organize data in a way that allows for even better algorithms. 

Data structures are just organizational tools that allow for more advanced algorithms. Some examples:
- **Stacks**: Last in, first out. 
- **Queues**: first in, first out. 
- **Linked lists**: a chain of nodes, efficient for inserts and deletes
- **binary trees**: a tree where each node has up to two children. 
- **red black trees**: a self-balancing binary tree using colors. 
- **hashmaps**: a data structure that maps keys to values
- **tries**: a tree used for storing and searching words efficiently. 
- **graphs**: a collection of nodes connected by edges. 

### Assignment
implement the `count_marketers` function. It should accept a list of strings (job titles) and return the number of users who've set their title to `"marketer"`. LockedIn users sometimes use different casing in their titles, so make sure to account for that. 
``` python
count = count_marketers(['programmer', 'marketer', 'doctor', 'marketer'])
print(count)
# prints "2"
```
#### Tip
The .lower()  method can be used to convert a string to lowercase. 

``` python
def count_marketers(job_titles):
	count = 0
	for j in job_titles:
		if "marketer" == j.lower():
			count += 1
	return count
```
