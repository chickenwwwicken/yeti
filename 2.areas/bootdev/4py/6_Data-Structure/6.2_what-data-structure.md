A data structure is  a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. 
More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. --- Wiki definition.

In other words, data structure:
- stores data
- organizes data so that it can easily be accessed and modified. 
- contains algorithmic functions to expose the ability to read and modify the data

You're already familiar with some of Python's built-in, simple data structures: 

**List:** an unordered collection of items
`animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse']`
**Dictionary:** collections of key/value pairs
``` python
car = {
	"brand": "Ford", 
	"model": "Mustang",
	"year": 1964
}
```
