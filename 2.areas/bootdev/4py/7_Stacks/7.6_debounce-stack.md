On the LockedIn platform, we use a stack to store the last few actions a user has taken. This allows us to implement an "undo" feature. When a user clicks the "undo" button, we pop the last action off the stack and reverse it. 

However, sometimes users accidentally take an action multiple times in a row. For example, a user might accidentally click the "add connection" button twice. In this case, we don't want to add the same action to the stack twice. We only want to add the action to the stack if it's different from the last action. 

### Assignment
Complete the `DebounceStack` class. 
1. It should inherit from the `Stack` class. 
2. Override the `.push()` method in the `DebounceStack` class. If the action on the top of the stack is of the same as the action being pushed, then the push operation fails and nothing happens. Otherwise, use the `.push()` method of the `Stack` class to push the action onto the stack. 

``` python
from stack import Stack

class DebounceStack(Stack):
	def push(self, action):
		top_action = self.peek()
		if top_action == action:
			#  If the action is the same as the top action, do nothing
			return
		#  Otherwise, push the action onto the stack
		super().push(action)
```
