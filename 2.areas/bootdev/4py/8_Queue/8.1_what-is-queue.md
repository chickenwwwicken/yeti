A queue stores ordered items... again, kind of like a list, but again, like a stack, its design is more restrictive. A queue only allows items to be added to the tail of the queue and removed from the head of the queue.

It's called a "queue" because it behaves like a queue of people waiting in line to order coffee.

The first person to get in line is also the first person to be served (get out of line). So, you'll often hear a queue referred to as a `FIFO` (first in, first out) data structure.
