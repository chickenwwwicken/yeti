So how fast are queue operations? Well, in an optimized queue, they'd be:

| Operation | Big O  | Description                                                      |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| push      | `O(1)` | Add an item to the back of the queue                             |
| pop       | `O(1)` | Remove and return the front item from the queue                  |
| peek      | `O(1)` | Return the front item from the queue without modifying the queue |
| size      | `O(1)` | Return the number of items in the queue                          |

Just like a stack, _all_ operations are `O(1)`! No matter how many items are in the queue, these operations will always take the same amount of time. The reason to choose a queue over a stack is all about _ordering_. Queues should be used when you need to process items in _the order they were added_.

LIFO (stack) vs FIFO (queue).

### A Problem

Our current `Queue` class has a problem... take a look at the `push` method:

```python
def push(self, item):
    self.items.insert(0, item)
```

It's _not_ `O(1)`! The List's `insert` method has to shift all the other items in the list down to make room for the new item.

We'll solve this very solvable problem soon... 


#### Questions
What is the Big O complexity of the push, pop, peek, and size operations of an optimized queue?
- O(1)
If an item could be anywhere in a queue, what is the Big O complexity to retrieve that item?
- O(n) because you might have to pop all the items in the queue
Why is our list-based queue's `push` operation O(n)?
- Because you have to move all the elements over by one index to make room for the next element.
