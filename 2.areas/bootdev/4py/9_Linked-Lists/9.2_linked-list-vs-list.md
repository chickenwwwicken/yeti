A linked list is a collection of ordered items, so it's similar to a "normal" list (also called an "array" or "slice" in other languages).

Items in a "normal" list are stored next to each other in memory, and to get an item from a normal `List` we have to use a numbered index:
``` python
car = cars[420]
```
You can think of the "index" as simply an offset from the start. The `cars` list in this example refers to the start of the list, and `420` is just the 420th item in that section of memory. With a normal list, all the data is stored in the same place in memory annd the index is just a way to find the right spot. 

In aa linked list, there are no indexes! Each node contains two things: the data itself, and a reference to the next node in the list. Iterating over a linked list requires startinng at the head node and following the `next` references until you reach the ennd. 

``` python
current_car_node = head_car_node
while current_car_node is not None:
    print(current_car_node.val)
    current_car_node = current_car_node.next
```
Frankly, linked lists can be annoying to use and incur more oveerhead, so why use a linked list at all? It's because sometimes linked lists are much faster to make updates to, particularly when innserting or deleting items from the middle. 

In a normal list, if you insert an item in the middle, you have to shift all the items after it down one spot, which takes `O(n)` time:

In a linked list, once you've traversed to a given node, insertion is `(O(1))` because you can simply update two references:
