For added flexibility, let's allow users to add items to the front of our linked list as well. 

### Assignment
**Implement the `add_to_head` method.** It should add a new node to the front of the list and return nothing.
- Set the "next" field of the given node to the current head node. 
- Update the head reference to the given node.

``` python
from node import Node

class LinkedList:
	def add_to_head(self, node):
		node.next = self.head
		self.head = node

	def add_to_tail(self, node):
		if self.head is None:
			self.head = node
			return 
		last_node = None
		for current_node in self:
			last_node = current_node
		last_node.set_next(node)

	def __init__(self):
		node = self.head
		while node is not None:
			yield node
			node = node.next

	def __repr__(self):
		nodes = [ ]
		for node in self:
			nodes.append(node.val)
		return " -> ".join(nodes)
```
