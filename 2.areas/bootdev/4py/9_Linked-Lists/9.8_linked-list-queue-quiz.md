Let's recap a few key points about linked lists and queues:
1. The problem with our array (normal Python list) implementaation of a queue was that it had `O(n)` push operations.
2. The linked list implementation of a queue has `O(1)` push operations. 
3. Linked lists are usually a worse choice than standard arrays because:
	- They are less performant due to more memory overhead
	- they are more complex to work with, debug, and reason about
	- they have no random access (indexing to a specific element)
4. Doubly linked lists are a better choice than arrays in very specific circumstances because they have `O(1)` insertions and deletions at both ends of the list. 

#### Questions
A Queue made with a linked list instead of an array...
- ... can have O(1) pushes and pops
A Queue that uses an array doesn't have `O(1)` pushes and pops because
- When elements are added or removed from thhe first index of the array all the items need to shift, which takes O(n) time
