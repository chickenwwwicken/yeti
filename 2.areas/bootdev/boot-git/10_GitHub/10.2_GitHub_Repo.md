Just like we created a ```weblyx-local``` repo and used ```webflyx``` as a remote, GitHub makes it easy to create "remotes" that are hosted on their site.

#### Assignment
1. Create a new repo on GitHub called ```webflyx```. 
2. Leave it completely blank, and make sure it's public
3. Authenticate your local Git configuration with your GitHub accound
4. Install the GitHub CLI with this command using [webi](https://webinstall.dev/gh/) 

``` bash
curl -sS https://webi.sh/gh | sh
```

Make sure you're authenticated by running this command to login through browser:

``` bash
gh auth login
```

5. Navigate back into your ```webflyx``` repo locally, it's going to be our "local" repo, you can forget about or delete ```webflyx-local``` if you want.
6. Add a remote to your ```webflyx``` repo that points to the ```webflyx-remote``` repo you just created.
That command should look like this:

``` bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/webflyx.git
```

Be sure to replace ```your-username``` with your actual GitHub username

7. Run ```git ls-remote``` to make sure the remote was added correctly.

Submit tests from inside your ```webflyx``` directory.
