The ```git push``` command pushes (sends) local changes to any "remote" - in our case, GitHub. 
For example, to push our local ```main``` branch's commits to the remote ```origin```'s ```main``` branch we would run:

``` bash
git push origin main
```

You need to be authenticated with the remote to push changes, 
which you should have done in the last lesson.

#### Alternative Options
You can also push a local branch to a remote with a different name: 

``` bash
git push origin <localbranch>:<remotebranch>
```

It's less common to do this, but nice to know. 

You can also delete a remote branch by pushing an empty branch to it:

``` bash
git push origin :<remotebranch>
```

#### Assignment
Let's push our local ```main``` branch to the remote ```origin``` repo for safekeeping!
Run ```git push origin main``` from within the ```webflyx``` directory (which should have your GitHub repo configured as a remote.)

Navigate to your GitHub repo in your browser and make sure that all your files and commits are there.

Paste the link to your repo and submit the tests.
