Fetching is nice, but most of the time we want the *actual file changes* from a remote repo, not just the metadata. 

#### Command Syntax
``` bash
git pull [<remote>/<branch>]
```

The syntax ```[...]``` means that the bracketed remote and branch are optional.
If you execute git pull without anything specified it will pull your current branch from the remote repo.

#### Assignment
Let's use the GitHub UI to commit a change to our remote repo.
Then we'll pull that change down to our local repo.
1. Navigate to your GitHub repo in your browser
2. Navigate to the ```classics.csv``` file on the main branch
3. In the top right corner, click "Edit this file"
4. Add a new line to the end of the file:
``` 
Willow, Ron Howard, 1988
```

5. Commit the change using the UI, but change the message to : "J: Update classics.csv"
6. On your command line, make sure you're on your ```main``` branch
7. ```merge``` the changes from the ```update_dune``` branch back into ```main``` so that main has everything we've done so far (A through I)
8. Run ```git pull origin main``` to pull in the most recent ```J``` commit that you made remotely (If you get a "divergent branches" error, run ```git config pull.rebase false``` to make sure git will merge on a pull, then try again.)
9. You should see that it starts a merge commit. Rename the merge commit message to start with ```K:``` 
10. Make sure everything worked with ```git log  --oneline```. You should have commits "A" through "K" locally.

Run tests from inside ```webflyx``` directory.
