it's pretty normal to use the following workflow from the top level of your repo:
1. ```git add .```
2. ```git commit -m "some message"```
3. ```git push origin main```

A problem arises when we want to put files in our project's directory, but we don't want 
to track them with Git.
A ```.gitignore``` file solves this. 
For example, if you work with Python, you probably want to ignore automatically generated files like ```.pyc``` and ```__pycache__```. 
If you are building a server you probably want to ignore ```.env``` files that might hold private keys.
If you work with JavaScript, you might want to ignore the ```node_modules``` directory.

example: 

``` 
# .gitignore file containing:
node_modules
```

This ```.gitignore``` file will ignore any file that has ```node_modules```:
- ```node_modules/code.js```
- ```src/node_modules/code.js```
- ```src/node_modules```

It will not ignore:
- ```node_modules_2```
- ```src/node_modules_3/code.js```
- ```env/node_modules_4```

#### Assignment
Create 2 files in your repo:
Create ```secure/passwords.txt``` 
Create ```secure``` dir if it doesn't exist
Paste the following and save: 

```
root: 12345
admin: 54321
lane: 00000
prime: APICJJY$$PO!NJ@L
```

Create a file called ```guilty_pleasures.md``` in the root dir and paste the following

```
# Guilty Pleasures (tell no one)

* The Notebook
* The Love Guru
* Birdemic: Shock and Terror
* Troll 2
* Manos: The Hands of Fate
* Sharknado
```

Create a ```.gitignore``` file and ensure both of those files are ignored

```
guilty_pleasures.md
secure
```

Commit changes, including ```.gitignore``` file.
Message starting with ```M:```

run from the root of your project dir.
