Your ```.gitignore``` file does not necessarily need to be at the root of your project.
It's common to have multiple ```.gitignore``` files in different directories throughout project.
A nested ```.gitignore``` file only applies to the directory it's in and its subdirectories.

Let's say u have following setup:

```
src/
├── assets/
│   ├── .gitignore
|   ├── cover_art.jpg
│   └── onlydevs.png
├── main.py
├── tests.py
├── venv/
│   └── bin/
|       ├── activate
│       └── python
.gitignore
```

Here's the contents of ```src/assets/.gitignore```:

```
onlydevs.png
main.py
```

Here's the contents of the root ```.gitignore```:

```
venv/bin/activate
```
