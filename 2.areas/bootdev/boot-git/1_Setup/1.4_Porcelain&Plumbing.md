In Git, commands are divided into high-level ('porcelain') commands and low-level ('plumbing') commands. 

The porcelain commands are the ones that you will use most often as a developer to interact with your code. Some porcelain commands are:
- ```git status```
- ```git add```
- ```git commit```
- ```git push```
- ```git pull```
- ```git log```

Plumbing commands are
- ```git apply```
- ```git commit-tree```
- ```git hash-object```

We'll focus on the high-level commands because that's what u use 99% of the time as a dev.
