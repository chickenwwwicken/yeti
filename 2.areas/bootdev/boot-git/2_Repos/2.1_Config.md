The very first step of any project is to create a repo. 
A git 'repo' represents a single project.
U typically have one repo for each project u work on

Essentially just a directory that contains a project.
The only difference is that it *also* contains a hidden ```.git``` directory. 
That [hidden directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory) is where Git stores all of its internal tracking and versioning info.
