A git repo is a list of commits
Where each commit represents the *full state of the repository* at a given point in time. 

The git log command shows a history of the commits in a repo.
This is what makes Git a VCS. U can see:
- who made a commit
- when the commit was made
- what was changed

#### A Commit Hash
Each commit has a unique identifier called 'commit hash'. 
This is a long string of chars that uniquely identifies the commit. 
For convenience u can refer to any commit or change within Git by using first 7 chars of hash.

#### Assignment
Run the ```git log``` command. You should see ur commit. 
Notice that ```git log``` starts an interactive pager. 
Scroll through w arrow keys
exit pressing ```q``` 

run ```git log``` but ```git log --no-paper log -n 10``` 
(limits the maximum number of commits shown, and to run without interactive pager)
