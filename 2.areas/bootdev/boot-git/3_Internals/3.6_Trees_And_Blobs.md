Terms to know for plumbing
- ```tree```: git's way of storing a directory
- ```blob```: git's way of storing a file

Here's what I got when I inspected from my last commit: 

``` bash
> git cat-file -p 5ba786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f

tree 4e507fdc6d9044ccd8a4a3061324c9f711c4667d
author ThePrimeagen <the.primeagen@gmail.com> 1705891256 -0700
committer ThePrimeagen <the.primeagen@gmail.com> 1705891256 -0700

A: add contents.md
```

We can see:
- the tree
- the author
- the committer
- the commit message

We cannot see the contents of the ```contents.md``` file itself! 
That's because the ```tree``` object stores it

#### Assignment
1. Use ```git cat-file -p``` again, but this time with the hash of the ```tree``` object instead of the commit hash. 
2. You should see a ```blob``` object with its own hash
3. Use ```cat-file``` again to view the contents of the ```blob``` object. 
4. Run and submit the CLI tests, providing the same blob hash.
