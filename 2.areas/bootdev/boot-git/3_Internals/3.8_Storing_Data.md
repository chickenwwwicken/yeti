Git stores an entire *snapshot* of files on a *per-commit* level. 

#### Optimization
While it's true that Git stores entire snapshots, it *does* have some performance optimizations so that your ```.git```
directory doesn't get too unbearably large. 
- Git compresses and packs files to store them more efficiently
- Git deduplicates files that are the same across different commits. If a file doesn't change between commits, Git will only store it once

#### Assignment
1. Use ```git cat-file -p``` to view the hash of the ```blob``` for the ```titles.md```
