Typically, in a key/value store, like a Python Dictionary, you aren't allowed to have duplicate keys.
Strangely enough Git doesn't care.

#### Unset All
The ```--unset-all``` flag is useful if you  ever *really* want to purge all instances of a key from your configuration. Conversely, the ```--unset``` flag only works with a  single instance of a key.  
``` bash
git config --unset-all example.key
```

####  Assignment 
While only the most unhinged of projects operate this way, some projects,  including WebFlyx, allow for multiple CEOs. Let's add a few more CEOs to the WebFlyx  configuration:

``` bash
git config --add webflyx.ceo "Warren"
git config --add webflyx.ceo "Carson"
git config --add webflyx.ceo "Sarah"
```

Take a look at ur new cursed configuration:
``` bash
git config --list  --local
```

Remove all the CEOs from  the WebFlyx configuration at once using the ```--unset-all``` flag.
