We've been using Git's default ```master``` branch.
Interestingly, Github recently changed its default branch from ```master``` to ```main```. 
As a general rule, I recommend using ```main``` as your default branch if you work with Github.

##### How to Rename a Branch
``` bash
git branch -m oldname newname
```

##### Assignment
Change your global Git configuration to use ```main``` as the default branch.
Change the ```init.defaultBranch``` key to ```main```

Check your current branch:
``` bash
git branch
```

You should notice that you're still on ```master``` 
That's because all you did was change the default branch for new repositories.
To switch this repo to use ```main```, rename the ```master``` branch to ```main``` 

Once it's renamed, run ```git branch``` again to make sure you're on the ```main``` branch.
