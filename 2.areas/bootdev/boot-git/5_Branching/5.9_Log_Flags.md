```git log``` shows you the history of commits in your repo.
There are a few flags to make the output easier to read. 

The first is ```--decorate```  :
- ```short``` (default)
- ```full``` (shows the full ref name) 
- ```no``` (no decoration) 

Run ```git log --decorate=full```. 
You should see that instead of just using ur branch name, it will show the full ref name
A ref is just a pointer to a commit.
All branches are refs, but not all refs are branches.

Run ```git log --decorate=no```. 
You should see that the branch names are no longer shown at all.

Run ```git log --oneline``` 
This flag will show you a more compact view of the log. 
Easy to see whats goin on
