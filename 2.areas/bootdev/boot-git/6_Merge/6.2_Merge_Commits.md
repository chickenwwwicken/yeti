A merge commit is the result of merging two branches together.

example: We start with this:
```
A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    vimchadsonly
```

And we merge ```vimchadsonly``` into ```main``` by running this while on ```main```:
```
git merge vimchadsonly
```

The merge will:
1. Find the "merge base" commit, or "best common ancestor" of the two branches (In this case, "A")
2. Replays the changes from ```vimchadsonly``` onto ```main``` starting from the best common ancestor.
3. Records the result as a new commit, in our case "F"
4. "F" is special because it has *two parents*, "C" and "E".

After:
```
A - B - C - F    main
   \     /
    D - E        vimchadsonly
```

#### Assignment
Your current ```webflyx``` commit history should look like this:
```
A - B - C - E    main
         \
           D     add_classics
```

Let's get the changes from the ```add_classics``` branch merged into the ```main``` branch. 
You will be presented with a code editor to change the commit message. 
Update the message to start with ```F:``` 
Use default message ```F: Merge branch 'add_classics'```
Save the file + close the editor. 
From ```main``` branch run ```git log --oneline --decorate --graph --parents```
this should give you a nice visual representation of merge commit
