![[ss6.3_Merge_Log.png]]Each ```*``` represents a commit in the repo.
There are  multiple commit hashes on each line because the ```--parents``` flag logs the parent hash(es) as well.
- The first line, with these three hashes: is our recent merge commit. 
	- The first hash is the merge commit's hash
	- The other  2 are the parent commits
- The  next section is  a visual representation of the branch  structure. It  shows the commits on  the ```add_classics``` branch and the ```main``` branch before the merge,  they both share a common parent.
- The next  three lines are just "normal" commits, each pointing to their parent.
- The last line is the initial commit and therefore has no parent.
