"Rebase vs Merge" is one of the most hotly debated topics in the Git world.
A lot of the discussions you'll see online come down to the fact that many devs don't understand the purpose of rebase and use it incorrectlyy, causing a bunch of Git havoc, and then blame the rebase command.

#### Visualizing Rebase
```
A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    feature_branch
```

We're working on ```feature_branch```, and want to bring in the changes our team added to ```main``` so we're not working with a stale branch. 
We could merge ```main``` into ```geature_branch```, but that would create an additional merge commit.
Rebase avoids a merge commit by replaying the commits from ```geature_branch```  on top of ```
main``` .
After  a rebase, the history will look like this:
```
A - B - C         main
         \
          D - E   feature_branch
```
