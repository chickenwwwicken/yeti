We need a new feature branch, but to be able to practice a rebase, we want it to not include some of the recent commit on ```main```  

#### Assignment
Use the git switch command to create and switch to a new branch called ```update_dune```, but branch off of the ```D``` commit. You can supply the commit hash directly to the ```git switch``` command:
``` bash
git switch -c update_dune COMMITHASH
```

Replace ```COMMITHASH``` with the hash of the ```D``` commit, which you can get with a git log command.

Verify with ```git log --oneline -n 1``` that you are on the new branch and that ```D```  is the last commit. 

Run and submit from the ```update_dune``` branch.
