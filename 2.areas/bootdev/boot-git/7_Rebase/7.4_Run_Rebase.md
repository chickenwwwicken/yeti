To use rebase to bring changes from ```main``` onto the current branch (let's call it ```jdsl```), we would run this while on the ```jdsl``` branch:
``` bash
git rebase main
```

This will do the following:
1. Checkout the latest commit on ```main```
2. Replay one commit at a time from ```jdsl``` onto ```main```
3. Update the ```jdsl``` branch to point to the last replayed commit
4. The rebase doesn't affect ```main``` while ```jdsl``` has all of the changes from ```main```

#### Assignment 
Add two commits to the ```update_dune``` branch.
Add the following quotes to the ```quotes/dune.md``` file's list:
- "The spice must flow." (Use a commit message starting with ```H:```)
- "Fear is the mind-killer." (Use a commit message starting with ```I:```)
While still on the ```update_dune``` branch, rebase your changes onto ```main```
```main``` is the base, and we want ```update_dune```'s changes on top of it.
