git rebase and git merge are different tools. 

An advantage of merge is that it preserves the true history of the project.
It shows when branches were merged and where.
One disadvantage is that it can create a lot of merge commits, which can make the history harrder to read and understand.

A linear history is generally easier to read, understand, and work with.
Some teams enforce the usage of one or the other on their ```main``` branch, but generally speaking, you'll be able to do whatever you want with your own branches.

#### Warning
You should never rebase a public branch (like ```main```) onto anything else. 
Other devs have it checked out, and if you change its history, you'll cause a lot of problems
However, with your own brranch, you can rebase onto other branches (including a public branch like ```main```) as much as you want.


Its generally bad manners to rebase a public branch onto your own personal branch

It's generally okay to merge changes into your own private branch, or to rebase your branch into a public branch.
