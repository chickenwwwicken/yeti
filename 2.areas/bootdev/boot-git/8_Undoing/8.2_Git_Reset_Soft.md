Git Reset command can be used to undo the last commit(s) or any changes in the index (staged but not committed changes) and the worktree (unstaged and not committed changes).

``` bash
git reset --soft COMMITHASH
```

The ```--soft``` option is useful if you just want to go back to a previous commit, but keep all of your changes.
Committed changes will be uncommitted and staged, while uncommitted changes will remain staged or unstaged as before.

#### Assignment
Your current branch, ```update_dune``` , should be at commit ```J``` with a changed ```titles.md``` 

Get the ```I``` commit hash from ```git log```, then run ```git reset --soft <hash>``` to go back to the ```I``` commit while keeping the changed  ```titles.md``` (staged but not commited).

```J``` should be gone from the commit log. Run and submit the CLI tests from the root of your webflyx directory.
