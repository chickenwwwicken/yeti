Last lesson, we undid a commit but kept the changes. 
We don't wanna keep the changes to ```titles.md``` here's how to reset those changes. 

``` bash
git reset --hard COMMITHASH
```

This is useful if you just want to go back to a previous commit and discard all the changes. 

#### Assignment
Run ```git status``` to confirm a staged change that modified the ```titles.md``` file.
Run ```git reset --hard``` to undo the change. Dont move on before u do this!

``` bash
git status
```
