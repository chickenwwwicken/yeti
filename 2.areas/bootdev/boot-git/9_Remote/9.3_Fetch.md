Adding a remote to our Git repo does not mean that we automagically have all the contents of the remote. 
First, we need to fetch the contents

#### Command

``` bash
git fetch
```

This downloads copies of all the contents of the ```.git/objects``` directory (and other book-keeping information) from the remote repository into your current one. 

#### Assignment

Before fetching the data itself, let's take a look at the new empty repo's ```.git/objects``` directory with ```find``` 

``` bash
find .git/objects
```

It should be empty with only 3 entries because we haven't fetched anything yet.

Run from the root of the ```webflyx-local``` dir.
