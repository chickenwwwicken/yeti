The ```git log``` command isn't only useful for your local repo. You can log the commits of a remote repo as well!

``` bash
git log remote/branch
```

For example , if u wanted to see the commits of a branch called ```primeagen``` from a remote named ```origin``` you would run:

``` bash
git log origin/primeagen
```

#### Assignment
Run ```git log``` on the remote ```webflyx``` repo's ```update_dune``` branch using the ```--oneline``` flag. 
Do it from within the ```webflyx-local``` repo. 
You should see commits "A" through "I".

Run tests from inside new ```webflyx-local```
