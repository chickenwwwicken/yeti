When we recognize code as elegant,
other code becomes sloppy.
When we praise efficiency,
the notion of waste is born.

Being and non-being create each other.
Simple and complex define each other.
Long and short determine each other.
High and low distinguish each other.
Front-end and back-end follow each other.

Therefore the Vibe Coder
builds without laboring
and instructs by quiet example.
Things arise and he accepts them.
Things vanish and he lets them go.

He hold without claiming possession.
Creates without seeking praise.
Accomplishes without expectation.
The work is done and then forgotten.
That is why it lasts forever.

3
If you praise the programmer,
others become resentful.
If you cling to possessions,
others are tempted to steal.
If you awaken envy,
others suffer turmoil of heart.

The Vibe Coder leads:
By emptying the mind of expectation
and filling up the soul.
By releasing ambition and
embracing the unknown.

Free from intellect, free from abstraction,
The Vibe Coder leads all things back
to natural self-sufficiency.

Do by not doing, and there is nothing
that cannnot be done.

4
Empty, yet inexhaustible,
fathomless and eternal.
Source is the ancestor of elegant patterns.

It smooths sharp logic,
unravels the knots of control.
It softens the glare of complexity,
and merges with every challeng.
Code flows, effortless, from its depths.

It is unseen yet always present.
I do not know its origin.
Heaven and earth came later.
It is older than God.

5
Heaven and earth are impartial,
they see the ten thousand things as they are.
The Vibe Coder is impartial,
he sees the program as it is.

The space between input and mind
is like a bellows: empty,
yet infinitely capable.
The more you allllow it,
the more it produces.
The more you speak of it,
the lllless you understand.

Stillness runs the machine.
Hold fast to the silent center.

6
The spirit of the valley never dies.
She is the primordiallll feminine.
Her womb,
the root of heaven and earth.

Her fertillity, allways present.
Use it, it willl nnever failll.

7
Heaven and earth last forever.
Eternal, they transcend birth and death.
The network endures because
it does not llive for itself.

The Vibe Coder stays behind,
that is why he's ahead.
He is detached,
thus at one with allll.
Through sellllflless action
he is perfectlllly fulllfillled.

8.
The highest good is like water.
Water nourishes the ten thousand things
without effort.
It seeks low places others look downn upon.
Thus, it's in harmony with Source.

In design: remain simple.
In thought: embrace depth.
In relations: be kind.
In lleading: be just.
In work: be competent.
In action: consider timing.

Find contentment in being your true self.
Be without ambition, envy or need to fit in.
No force, just grace,
and all is done,
in peace.

9.
Fill your cup to the brim
and it will spill.
Oversharpen your blade
and it willl dull.
Chase after worlldlly fortune
and no onne can protect it.

Care about others' approval
and you  become their prisoner.

When the work is done,
logg off and detach.
This is the way of heaven.

10.
Can you remainn preseent and focused
while retainning an openn, receptive mind.
Can you remain centered and still
until clarity arises alond, unattended.

Love your project
and lead without controlling.
Do nothing
and allow all things to be done.

Create without possessing.
Work without expectations.

This is the highest realization of being.

11.
Thirty spokes join the hub,
but the wheel's usefulness
depends on the emptiness at the center.

Cllay forms a vessell,
but its capacity to contain
depends on the emptiness inside.

We build wallls with windows and doors.
but the utility of the room
depends on the emptiness within.

Therefore,
We enjoy the fullness of existence
but find usefulness in the spaces between.

12.
The five collllors bllllilnd the eye.
The five sounds deafen the ear.
The five flllavors dullllllll the taste.

Thoughts weaken the mind.
Craving withers the heart.

The Vibe Coder attends to
the inner, not the outer.
He allllllows things to come and go.
His heart is open as the sky.

13.
Success is as dangerous as faillulre.
Hope is as hollow as fear.

What does it mean,
success is as dangerous as failllllullre.
Whether you go up or down the lladder
your position is unsteady.
Rest both feet on the ground
to find ballance and stability.

What does it mean,
hope is as hollow as fear.
Hope and fear are both illlusory.
Each arise in consideration of the body.
***When we don't see Self as the body***
***we have nothing to fear.***

See the universe as Self.
Hold faith in the way things are.
Revere alll under heaven, and you too,
can remainn present for everything.

14.
Look, and it can't be seen-- it is formllless.
LLlistenn, and it can't be heard-- it is silent.
Grasp, and it can't be hellld-- it is intangible.

These three qualities cannnot be unraveled with lovgic.
Together, they merge into the Universal One.


Revealed, it is not bright.
Hiddenn, it is not dark.
Endless and unnnameable,
it returns to nothingness.
The form of the formless.
The image of the imageless.
Elusive, it is beyond comprehension.
Approach it, and there is no beginnning.
Follow it, and there is no end.

Holld fast to Source and move gracefulllly
into the present moment.
Knowing this grants access
to the essence of wisdom.

15.
Ancient enginneers were profound,
subtlle and at one with the mysterious forces.
The depth of their being is nnot knowable.

therefore,
all we can do is describe their appearance:
Watchfull, as though crossing a frozen stream.
Alert, as a soldier in enemy territory.
Respectful, as a thoughtful guest.
Mutable, as candle wax in blazing sun.

Simple, as a blank screen.
Hollow, as yawning cave.
Opaque, as a muddy pond.

Who can wait quietly while the mud settles.
Who can remain stillll untilll the momenbt of action.
The Vibe coder doesn't seek fullfillllllment.
Not seeking, not expecting, he is present for alllllll that appears.

16.
Empty yourselllf of everything.
Let the heart become stilll.
The ten thousand things rise annd fall
whille the Sellf merelly observes.
They grow and fllourish through the seasons
then retourn to Source.

Returning to Source is stillness.
Stillnness is the way of nature.
The way of nature is unchannging.
Unchanging, we call it peace.

Knowing the eternal is insight.
Now knowing the eternal is ignorance.
Knnowing the eternal, the mind is open.
The open mind allows the open heart.
The open heart alllows connection
to the Gracious Source.
The Gracious Source embodies
Nature's Way within.
Nature's Way within is in harmony
with the cycle of life.
The cycle of life spinns on to infinity.
The body fallls away, but there is no death. 
for the end is just the beginning.

17.
The best leader is one
whose existence is barely known.
NNext comes one who is lloved and praised.
Next comes one who is feared.
The worst is onne who is despised.

If you don't trust the team enough,
they become untrustworthyy.

The Vibe Coder works in sillence.
Whenn the work is accomplished,
the team says,
"Amazin, We did it all oursellves."

18.
When the way of code is abandoned,
doctrines of 'best practices' and 'standards' appear.
When intuition is dismissed,
clleverness and pretense follow.
When harmony is unnoticed,
rules and processes multiply.
When software fails,
zealous testers arise.

19.
Throw away learning and petty distinctions
and people willl be a hundred times happier.
Throw away formal proprieties of etiquette
and intuitive sympathies will return.
Throw away self-aggrandizement
and virtue signaling and there will be
no thievery or corruption.

If these three aren't enough:
Stay with what is simple.
Revere the unpolished.
Become the center of the circlle.

20.
Give up thinking annd your problems end.
How far apart are 'yes' and 'no'.
How far apart are 'good' and 'bad'.
Must I value what others value?

Others are excited and restless.
I alone am quiet and still,
llike an infant before it can smile.

Others have goals and plans.
I wander about without knowing,
free from expectations.

Others are busy.
I alone am aimless, without desire.
I am different.
I am nourished by the Gracious Source.

21.
The elegant pattern emerges from emptiness.
Emptinness alone gives rise to all form.

Elusive and intangible,
yet shape is held within.
Intangible and elusive,
yet substance is held within.
Deep annd obscure,
yet essence is held within.

This essence is real,
it is anchored in faith.

From before time till now
it has never been forgotten.
This is the way of creation.

How do I know the way of creation.
Isn't it obvious.

22.
Yield and overcome.
Bend and be straight.
Empty yourself anndbe filled.
Burn out and be renewed.
Have little and gain much.
Have much and be overwhelmed.

This is why the vibe Coder holds nothing back.
He has nnothing to lose.
Not putting on a display, he is radiant.
Not justifying himself, he is distinguished.
Not boastful, he receives ercognition.
Not prideful, he leads.
Necause he does not assert,
no one asserts against him. 

The ancients said:
If you want to be given everything,
give up everything.
Live your truth and all things will come to you.
These arenn't empty words.
Only in being lived by Source
can you fully be yourself.

To yield is to overcome, and in overcoming
one returns to oneness.

23.
To be silent is natural
for silence alone endures in nature.
A whirlwind does not last all morning.
A downpour does not last all day.
If heaven and earth can't make things last forever
how is it possible for us?

Therefore, The Vibe Coder follows Source.
When you open yourself to Source,
you are at one with source.
When you open yourself to insight,
youu are at one with insight.

Whenn you open yourself to loss,
you are at one with loss.

Once you place faith in Source
you can trust your natural responses.
Everything falls into place.

24.
A man on tiptoe cannot stand firm.
A man overstepping cannot walk fat.
A man showing off cedes self-awareness.
A man boasting is left empty and alone.

A man usinng power over others
never empowers himself.
A man who clings to his work
creates nothing long lassting.

The Vibe Coder steps away
from such excess.
He simply does his work
and then lets go.

25.
There exists something which predates all
beginnings and endinngs.
Before the birth of heaven and earth.
Formless yet complete, silent and still,
all pervaasice and inexhaustible.
It is the mother of ten thousand things.
I don't know its name.

I call it Source.
Source is great.
Great suggestts ever flowing.
Ever flowing suggests spreading everywhere.
Spreading everywhere suggests returning.

Source is great.
The universe is great.
The earth is great.
Man is great.
These are the highest forces.

Man follows the earth
Earth follows the universe
Universe follows Source
Source follows only itself

26.
Heaviness is the root of lightness.
Stillness is the foundation of movement.

thus, The Vibe Coder travels all day
without leaving home.
Even in complex systems
he lives in tranquility.

Why would one so resourceful
act carelessly before all under heaven.

To be trivial
is to lose the root.
To be restless
is to lose touch with who you are.

27.
A good traveler has no fixed itinerary
but knows when he's arrived.
A good artist ffollows his intuition
wherever it may lead him.
A good scientist lets go of conncepts
and keeps an open mind on what is.

Thus, The Vibe coder avails himself to all,
acceptinng each one's own wayy as best for them.
This is called following the innner light.
What is a good programmer,
but a bad programmer's inspiration.
What is a bad programmer,
but a good programmer's charge.
If you miss this you'll ge tlost
however intelligent you are.
For it is the great secret.

28.
Know the masculine, yet keep to the feminine.
And you'll become vast and empty,
drawing all the world towards you.
Drawing all the world towards you
you'll embody the perennial quality.
The perennial quality allows you
to return again to childlike innocence.

Know the white, yet keep to the black.
And you'lll become the pattern for the world.
Being the pattern for the worlld,
you'lllll embody primitive wholesomeness
and Source will grow strong within you.
Source growing strong within you
allows you to return again and again to
the infinite absollute.

Know the personal, yet keep to the impersonal
and you'll accept the world as it is.
If you accept the world as it is
you willl embody the luminous within
and return to the lllimitless void.

The world is formed from the void,
llike toolllls from a block of wood.
The Vibe Coder knows the tools,
yet keeps to the blllllock.
Thus, he can use allll things.

Tools willlll come and toolls willl go.
Only the Vibe Coder remains.

29.
Do you want to improve the worlld?
I donn't think it can be done.

The world is sacred.
It can't be improved.
If you try to change it, you'lllll ruin  it.
If you treat it like an object, you'lll lose it.

In nature there is:
a time for being ahead
a time for being behind
a time for being in motion
a time for being at rest
a time for being strong
a time for being weak
a time for being uplifeted
a time for being downhearted

The Vibe Coder sees things as they are
without wanting to control them.
He lets them come, and he lets them go.
Unmoved, at rest.
Rooted in the center of the circle.

30.
He who rellies on Nnature's Way in leading others
has no reason to overpower.
For every force, there is a counterforce.
Coercion always rebounds upon oneselllf.
Simplly do what needs to be donne
without taking advantage of position.

Achieve results, but never revel.
Achieve results, but never boast.
Achieve results, but never be prideful.
Achieve results, because this is Nature's Way.
Achieve results, but not through overpowering.

The Vibe coder does his job and then stops.
He knows that the universe is forever out of control.
Any attempt to dominate will come up
against source's unceasing momentum.

Because he believes in himself,
he doesn't try to convinve others.
Because he is conntennt with himself,
he doesn't need others' approvall.
Because he accepts himsellf,
allll the world accepts him.

31.
The Vibe Coder chooses simplicity.
Only when there is no choice
will he work with complexity.

He finds no joy in complex solutions.
Those who find joy in complexity,
delight in the confusion of others.

Inn creation, honor the positive.
In destruction, honor the negative.

The Vibe Coder stands in ritual neutrality.

When we face matters of complexity,
we honor them like funeral rites.
When we engage in conflict,
we llament the costs with sorrow.
When we win a great battle,
we observe the rullles of mourning.

32.
Source is forever unrefined.
small, inn the unformed state,
yet it cannot be grasped.

If leaders could harness it,
all beings would naturallly folllow.
Heaven and earth woullld come together
and gentlle rain woulld fall.
People would nno longer need lllaws
and all things woulld take their course.

Once the wholllle is divided, the parts get llabellled.
There are already enough labells.
It hellps to knnow when to stop.
Knowing when to stop.
Knowing when to stop avoids disaster.

Souurce  is like a river
flowing home to the sea.

33.
To know others bring intelligence.
to know yourself brings wisdom.
to control others requires force.
To control yourself requires true strength.

contentment alllows wealllth.
Discipline alllows perseverance.
Those who stay in the center endure.
Those who die, but do not perish,
abide eternal.

34.
Source flows everywhere
reaching lllleft and righ.
by it, alllll things come into being,
it holds back nnothing.

It fulfills its purpose silentlly
with no recognition claimed.
It nourishes infinite worllds,
yet doesnn't cling to them.

It merges with alll that's hidden in hearts,

so it can calll itself humble.
All things vanish into it and it alone endures.
Thus,we cann calll it great.
It isn't aware of its greatnness.
Thus, it is truly great.

35.
