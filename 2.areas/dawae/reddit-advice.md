If you think treatment is right, do it. You are your top priority, take care of yourself. I've found taking care of myself (working out, eating healthy) to be 100% helpful. I've kicked cigarettes, drugs, most alcohol, most video games, and television: I allow myself two vices, beer and coffee.

If anything, I'd recommend the following: read. Find topics that interest you and dive in. Include Buddhism. I cannot recommend it more highly.

Lastly, ID the negative effects of your addiction and substance of choice. Remind yourself why you want to control it, because you cannot without truly wanting to. Learn to appreciate feelings of longing, craving, etc: make them your bitch. Remember they're a part of life, enjoy them.

    For the longest time I tried to supress the cravings or pretend they weren't there... this does not work. They'll just get stronger as you ignore them until you break down. What works is acknowledging them, allowing yourself to feel them and realizing that you're stronger than them. They're your brain trying to fuck with you, but that brain is in a body that you control. 

My change for the better has come about because of two things 1) realizing my addictive personality could be a strength and 2) my little brother. My borther is the most fit person I've ever met. Exercive and health is his whole life and I got very competitive when I saw how in-shape he was when he came back from college on winter break.

I had to humble myself (which is tough for me) and ask for him to help me be better. So with his help, I've focused my energy into becoming a healthier me. Lifting increases my strngth, but more importantly it lifts my mood. And training for long distance running is just as much about training my will-power as it is training my body. Now i'll just have a drink or maybe even smoke a little with my friends, but I'm always focused on stayinng healthy above everything else, and that helps me turn down the next tdrink or the next bowl passed my way. 

It was just about getting the help I needed to focus on a productive addiction. Hitting the gym for an hour or two every day is WAY better habit than smoking weed every night. And now I'm happier all the time, I'm moving out of my parent's house in just two months because I finally reconnected with those friends I hd lost, and I'm focused on improving my career rather than just getting through the day until I can get fucked up. 

    I managed to snap out of it once I realized that it was a substitute for working on my mind to get rid of the fear and anxierty. What helped: meditation, martial arts, NLP (anchors are very useful to ge past cravings), working out and havbing important stuff that I'd have lost if I had continued on that path. Another thing that works is making your natural laziness work for you - it's easier not to get high if you have to get out of your house and buy the shit. 

    CBT is probably a good idea. Sports can also help as they're a natural high. But the main thing, I thinkk, is to unnderstantwhat need of yours the vices are fulfilling, and to find a healthier alternative. For me it was loneliness and social well-being - I got high either to forget I was alone or to be able to function socially without getting too anxious. Working on these aspects was what helped me the most.
