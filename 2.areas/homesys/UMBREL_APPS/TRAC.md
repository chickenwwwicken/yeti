BennyTheDev set $TRAC in motion on 3rd May 2023

![[TRAC_FOTO1.webp]] 

### TRAC CORE

Indexer + Oracle 

Tool for organizing , searching , analyzing Bitcoin's info through APIs

Also serves as an Oracle for operations that need secure data both inside Bitcoin and outside of BlockChain , "stands at the crossroads of internal blockchain navigation and external data liaison"


![[TRAC_FOTO2.webp]] 

[BennyTheDev](https://medium.com/trac-systems/trac-core-for-tap-protocol-cfe60e10ba1b)

Focus on decentralized distribution of indexing data based on Ordinal-based metaprotocols .
Devs and projects can now download , install , and run their ready-to-use environments .
Eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with setting up Bitcoin Core and Ord Wallet .

by executing a simple 'git clone && npm start' you will already be participating in the Trac Indexing Network

Trac will continue to release metaprotocol packages . Bitmap , Bitmap Parcels , Pipe , Doginal-based metaprotocols , 

Additionally devs wwill have the opportunity to create and maintain new metaprotocols and participate in the Trac Network Ecosystem . This includes incentives to **earn revenue and run individual indexing businesses** . 


#### HOW iT WORKS

P2P Network of indexers validators and peers 

**Indexers** : also called writers , do the heavy lifting and commit their indexing results to the Trac Network

**Validators** : validate indexing data and reward indexers for correct data and availability . Validator access can be obtained through $TRAC tokens which gives the right to earn $TAP tokens . $TAP tokens will then be spread across indexers and validators based on their performance . 

**Peers** : also called readers , receive validated index data that can be used to support marketplaces , exchanges and any other app that developer seek to develop The user of peers is entirely free . *The release of "Trac Core for TAP Protocol" represents the release of the first peer application*

#### Peers (Readers)

This release supports readers for TAP Protocol and helps each peer -- as the name suggests -- to support each other . The more peers exist , the better and faster the data-retrieval . Think of these peers like Bittorrent but tailored for immediate and future requirements of the ecosystem . 


#### Requirements

To run "Trac Core for TAP Protocol" and start devving the requirements are pretty low : 

- NodeJS20+
- 2-4CoreCPUs , 8GB RAM
- 500GB SSD (depending on the metaprotocol)

This includes Raspberry Pi3-5 and multiple instances for diff protocols on one machine .

### TAP PROTOCOL

Cutting-edge multi-asset metaprotocol for Bitcoin Ordinals , enabling more complex financial operations directly on the Bitcoin Blockchain , powered by and benefiting Ordinals ecosystem . 

Designed to be more flexible and user-friendly than other token metaprotocols , enabling features like token staking , swapping , and liquidity pools . w/o need for secondary layers or complex mechanisms . 

Enables a Robust ecosystem for Bitcoin financial activities :

- Swapping and Staking
- Liquidity Pools
- Token Authentication
- TAP Art : linking Ordinals with tokens living on TAP protocol . 
- Multi-send : 
	- Send multiple transactions in one go 
	- distributing tokens to various recipients
	- Airdropping tokens within ordinals
- Multi-asset Protocol : can handle different types of assets beyond just one standard

### PiPE Protocol

UTXO based TX Monitor
This model ensures security against double spending and provides enhanced privacy and efficiency

- Art : supports TXs related to buying selling or transferring digital art pieces
- NFT : allows for the creation and management of NFTs 
- Inscribe : inscribe data onto a Bitcoin Transaction
- Transfer : Enables transfer of UTXOs

## THREAD

[@SEVAFTW](https://twitter.com/SevaFTW/status/1721539457638121624) 

#### 1/ How it started?

Creator of Ordinals 
@rodarmor
 basically rejected BRC20s and proposed RUNES standard--> more efficient token idea on Bitcoin than BRC20s

BUT RUNES does not allow for fair mints in a SIMPLE WAY which is an important aspect of BRC-20s

#### 2/

THAT potentially makes all it's tokens securities due to centralized distribution ❌

Tickers on RUNES start with 12–14 letters and they are random  ❌

Lower tickers will only be available over the years❌

#### 3/ Big Brain Benny

Shortly after Casey’s proposal Benny from 
@trac_btc
  came up with the solution and combination of both BRC20s and RUNES Standard--> PIPE protocol

PIPE tries to combine the strengths of both ideas

![[Pasted image 20240321205938.jpg]]

#### 4/

@PipeBtc
 is not only CHEAPER, FASTER and EASIER to use for builders and users than BRC20 but also inherits the original BRC-20 idea of fair minting (Deploy, Mint, Transfer = DMT) that RUNES standard do not have

#### 5/ PIPE PROTOCOL

PIPE is a token and art protocol for Bitcoin (Ordinals un-related) that utilizes the UTXO-model to transfer tokens and art (erc20, erc721, erc1155-style)

PIPE | DMT | Art

![[Pasted image 20240321210032.jpg]]

#### 6/ 

Pipe is UTXO-based and it's 100% on chain

With BRC20s you need to mint a token, if you want to transfer it you need to inscribe transfer amount and ONLY then you can send that transferable amount

It's super inefficient and unsustainable--> that's why BTC is so congested

#### 7/ 

With the PIPE protocol, it works like this:
- You mint and that is going into a utxo
- You can list this UTXO directly and transfer it directly

#### 8/ $PIPE TOKEN

Benny launched $PIPE token which was fair mint on September 27th 2023

$PIPE surged to 0.5 USD OTC and it’s getting a lot of traction already 

- 1st token ever on PIPE protocol
- 21m supply
- Fair and free mint
- Historical value
- Team didn’t mint any amount

![[Pasted image 20240321210213.jpg]]

#### 9/ PIPE TOKENS AND  PIPE ART

I would like to mention other tokens with solid volume like $RUNE, $ETCH and $INS. These are OGs, meme tokens, and even utility tokens 

There are already dozens of ART collections on the PIPE protocol but these are the OG ones:

![[Pasted image 20240321210235.jpg]]

#### 10/ How to BUY on PIPE protocol?

Good question!

Join the TRAC official Discord server

Currently the most popular way to buy is through OTC trading with verified OTC traders in the TRAC Discord server

With OTC trading there are always a lot of scams going around so be careful

#### 11/ PIPE Infrastructure

OTC trading will soon be gone

Lot of builders on PIPE already such as:

[@inscrib3](https://twitter.com/inscrib3)
 -> PIPE Wallet
[@SatsXio](https://twitter.com/SatsXio)
 -> PIPE Marketplace
[@RuneX_Tech](https://twitter.com/RuneX_Tech)
 -> PIPE DEX
[@Pipeline_btc]()
 -> PIPE Indexer
[@SuperExet](https://twitter.com/SuperExet)
 -> First CEX that listed $PIPE

Future is truly bright!

#### 11/ Final thoughts

IMO $PIPE has early $ORDI vibes

The $ORDI price skyrocketed from the OTC price of 0.5$ to 20$ when it was launched on the proper marketplace

PIPE is better token solution on BTC

I like BOTH Ordinals and PIPE 

Healthy competition, seeking the best solution
