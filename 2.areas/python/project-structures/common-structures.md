common structures for programming projects
### 1. understanding the problem
start by talking about a problem you had and solved it with code. 

### 2. have a plan
- what tech stack
- what general components of system
- what database
- what backend
- little plan/design for your project

### 3. Structure your Directories
something like this can work for a simple python project
-.git
-src
-.-main.py
-README.md



### 4. use vcs from beginning
use meaningful commits

### 5. modularize and componentize your code
better to have more files and more folders for reusability
short, reusable, easy-to-understand code

### 6. documentation
at minimum have:
- installation guides/troubleshooting guide
	- how to run
	- what do you need
- issues youve ran into or other people ran into + solution to those issues
maybe some README.md files for different parts of project

### 7. Testing
basic testing even for hobby projects

### 8. Dependency Management
try to use depenndencies that are well maintained
use something like pip or npm or mnpm
### 9. CI & CD
continuous integration and continuous deployment
this means automated testing with github actions
and automated deployment with whatever service used to deploy
make sure it's as easy as possible to run 

### 10. Reviewing your Code
