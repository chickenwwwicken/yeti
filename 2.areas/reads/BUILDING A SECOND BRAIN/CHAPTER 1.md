## THE FOUNDATION

The value of physical capital in the US  -- Land, machinery and buildings is $10 Trillion USD,
but the value of human capital is estimated to be five to ten times larger.

Human capital includes "the knowledge and the knowhow embodied in humans, their education, their experience, their wisdom, their skills, their relationships, their common sense, their intuition."

-  The first chapters show the practice of creating a second brain which is a long legacy of thinkers and creators who came before us and tried to achieve more.
-  Part Two "the Method", introduces four steps to build a Second Brain to capture and share ideas with more intention.
-  Part Three "Making Things Happen" offers a set of pwerful ways to use your Secound Brain to enhance productivity and accomplish your goals. }

This book is not about improving yourself. It's about optimizing a *system outside of yourself*.

# CHAPTER 2

## WHAT IS A SECOND BRAIN?

Information is the fundamental building block of everything you do!
- executing a project
- getting a job
- learning a new skill
- starting a business
Your professional success and quality of life depend directly on your ability to manage information effectively.

FUN FACTS
- avg person daily consumption of information is 34 GB
-  this is the equivalent of 174 full newspapers each day
-  research from microsoft shows that avg person spends 76 hrs a year looking for misplaced notes, items, or files.
-  26% of a typical knowledge worker's day is spent looking for and consolidating information across a variety of systems.
-  only 56% of the times they are able to find the information required to do their jobs.

It's time to acknowledge that we can't use our heads to store everything we need to know and to outsource the job of remembering to intelligent machines... The demand of cognitive functions of modern life increases every year, but we're still using the same brains as two hundred thousand years ago.

Every bit of energy we spend trying to recall things is energy not spent doing what humans do best : inventing new things, crafting stories, recognizing patterns, following our intuition, collaborating with others, investigating new subjects, making plans, testing theories. 


## The Legacy of Commonplace Books

The practice of writing down thoughts and notes to help make sense of the world has a long legacy. For centuries , artists, and intellectuals have recorded the ideas they found in a book they carried around with them, known as a #commonplace_book. 

	//  "Unlike modern readers, who follow the flow of a narrative from beginning to end, early modern Englishmen read in fits and starts and jumped from book to book. They broke texts into fragments and assembled them into new patterns by transcribing them in different sections of their notebooks. Then they reread the copies and rearranged the patterns while adding more excerpts. Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a countinuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality."
- the case for books, by historian #RobertDarnton 

Instead of consuming big amounts of content, we can take on a more patient, thoughtful approach that favors rereading, reformulating, and working through the implications of ideas over time!!

#commonplace_book  is what we call a Second Brain. The combination of a study notebook, personal journal, sketchbook for new ideas, a tool that can adapt to your changing needs overtime. for school courses, organizing projects, managing household. It's a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth.  A Laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking and a studio where you can experiment with ideas until they are ready.

## Rethinking Notetaking

More than half the workforce today can be considered "knowledge workers" -- this means professionals for whom knowledge is their most valuable asset. Where does your knowledge live? at the most practical level, knowledge begins with the simple, time-honored practice of taking notes. When you enter the professional world, the demands on your notetaking change completely:
- You're allowed to reference your notes at any time, provided you took them in the first place.
- You're expected to take action on your notes, not just regurgitate them. 

For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a "knowledge building block", a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.

By this definition a note could be anything, quotes, books, images, links, thoughts on a topic, all stored on a secure place. A knowledge building block is discrete. It stands on its own and has intrinsic value, but knowledge building blocks can also be combined into something bigger - a report, an argument, a proposal, a story. Like LEGOs 

With the Second Brain your stupid brain is no longer the bottleneck of your potential, which means you have all the bandwidth you need to pursue any endeavor with success. 

#Vannevar_Bush wrote of a scholar's workstation called a #Memex which was a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility, It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.


# CHAPTER 3

## How A Second Brain Works

	// It is in the power of remembering that the self's ultimate freedom consists. I am free because i remember.

A second Brain should be the world's best personal assistant. It is perfectly reliable and totally consistent. It is always ready and waiting to capture any bit of information that might be of value. 
- It follows directions
- makes helpful suggestions
- reminds you of what's important to you

What would the job description for such an assistant look like?

	// looking for a personal assistant:
	- must be organized
	- must have easy access to notes and files
	- multiple layers and areas of knowledge
	- reminder of important events and meetings
	- daily tracking of to dos and routines
	- easily adaptable for new ideas in different areas
	- able to redact emails and make phonecalls
	- able to do repetitive tasks with automation

In this chapter we'll see how the four main capabilities of a Second Brain will actively work for us- immediatly and overtime. how your Second Brain will evolve to serve what is most important to you; and an introduction to the four steps of the #CODE_method that lies at the heart of it all.

### The Superpowers of a Second Brain

There are four essential capabilities that we can rely on a Second Brain to perform for us: 
1. Making our ideas concrete. 
2. Revealing new associations between ideas. 
3. Incubating our ideas over time. 
4. Sharpening our unique perspectives.

#### Superpower #1 : Making our Ideas Concrete

Before anything ... OFF-LOAD

Only when we clear off our mind of complex ideas can we think clearly and start to work with those ideas effectively. 

Turn your thoughts visual of physical. This makes vague concepts into tangible entities that can be observed, rearranged, edited, and combined together. 

#### Superpower #2 : Reveal New Associations Between Ideas

Creativity is about connecting ideas together, especially ideas that don't seam to be connected.
"Creative people are better at recognizing relationships, making associations and connections"
- #Nancy_C_Anderson

Keeping diverse kinds of material in one place, we facilitate this connectivity and increase the likelihood that we'll notice an unusual association.

Quotes from a philosophy book written in ancient times might sit next to the latest tweet.
Screenshots of youtube videos can live right by scenes of classic movies.

Like scrabble, mixing the letters in different ways is the best way to come up with new words. In a second brain it is the same way, mixing up the order of our ideas until sumthing comes up.


#### Superpower #3 : Incubate Ideas Over Time

When we are creating something new, we draw only on the ideas we have access to right in that moment. This approach is "heavy lift" demanding instantaneous results from our brains without the benefit of a support system. 

This tendency is known as a *recency bias*, we tend to favor the ideas, solutions and influences that occurred to us most recently, regardless of whether they are the best ones. Unshackle yourself from the limits of the present moment and draw on weeks, or even years of accumulated imagination. 

This is the "slow-burn" approach, it is calmer more sustainable approach to creativity that relies on the gradual accumulation of ideas. Permanently saving lots of ideas for the long term turns the passage of time into your friend, instead of your enemy. 

#### Superpower #4 : Sharpen Our Unique Perspectives

A recent study found that there is a certain kind of job that is least likely to be automated by machines in coming years, the jobs that are most likely to stick around are those that involve promoting or defending a particular perspective.  A researcher using data to back up their interpretation of an experiment, or a project manager citing a couple of key precedents to support a decision and persuade others to adopt it as well. 

Advocating for a particular POV isn't just a matter of sparkling charisma or irresistible charm. It takes supporting material. 

If it feels like the well of inspiration has run dry, it's because you need a deeper well full of examples, illustrations, stories, statistics, diagrams, analogies, metaphors, photos, mindmaps, conversation notes, quotes- anything that will help you argue for your perspective or fight for a cause you believe in. 


### Choosing a Notetaking App : The Neural Center of Your Second Brain

NEEDS:

- **Multimedia**: store a wide variety of kinds of content
- **Informal**: messy, easy and frictionless as possible to jot.
- **Open**-**ended**: free-form exploration before you have goals in mind
- **Action**-**Oriented**:  Designed to help you quickly capture stray thoughts and remained focused on task

These qualities are shared by paper notes, but when digital, supercharged by capabilities like searching, sharing, backups, editing, linking, syncing between devices.

It's not about having perfect tools-- it's about having a *reliable* set of tools you can depend on, knowing you can change them later. 


### Remembering, Connecting, Creating: The Three Stages of Personal Knowledge Management

It takes time to fully unlock the value of using digital tools to enhance and extend what our minds are capable of, but there are also distinct benefits at every step along the way.

The first way that people tend to use their Second Brain is as a memory aid. For digital notes to save facts, ideas, takeaways from meetings, quotes from interviews, or details of a project.

The second way is to connect ideas together, evolving from a *memory* tool to a *thinking* too. A piece of advice from a mentor comes in handy as they encounter a similar situation on a different team. An illuminating metaphor from a book finds its way into a presentation. 

The third way and final is for creating new things. They realize that they have a lot of knowledge on a subject and decide to turn it into something concrete and shareable. 


## Introducing the CODE Method

**The Four Steps to Remembering What Matters**

As a guide in the process of creating your own Second Brain, there is a simple, intuitive four part method called **CODE** : Capture, Organize, Distill, Express.

**Capture**: Keep what resonates
**Organize**: Save for actionability
**Distill**: Find the Essence
**Express**: Show your work

**CODE** is a map for navigating the endless streams of information we are now faced with every day. It is a modern approach to creating a commonplace book, adapted to the needs of the Information Age.



### Capture: Keep what Resonates

We can't consume every bit of this juicy information stream. We need to adopt the perspective of a curator, stepping back from the raging river and starting to make intentional decisions about what information we want to fill our minds.

Capturing and Keeping only what resonates in a trusted place that you control and leave the rest aside. Often, the ideas that resonate are the ones that are most unusual, counterintuitive, interesting, or potentially useful. Look inside for a feeling of pleasure, curiosity, wonder, or excitement, and let that be your signal for when it's time to capture a passage, an image, a quote, or a fact.

This is a way of turning up the volume on our intuition so we can hear the wisdom it offers us. Training to notice this is a way to take better notes, and also understanding of ourselves!

Choose to consume information that adds value to our lives and consciously let go of the rest.


### Organize: Save for Actionability

Its tempting to try to create a perfect hierarchy of folders up front to contain every possible note you might ever take!!

Most people tend to organize information by subject, when it comes to digital notes, we can use much easier and lighter ways of organizing, our priorities and goals can change at a moment's notice, and probably will.

The best way to organize them is to *organize* *for* *action*, according to the active projects you are working on right now.

Consider new information in terms of its *utility* "How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects"

There are relatively few things that are actionable and relevant at any given time, which means you have a clear filter for ignoring everything else. This gives you the ultimate clarity!! Everything you're keeping actually has a purpose. 


### Distill: Find the Essence

Once you have ideas in a central place and organizing them for action you notice patterns.

	"An article you read about gardening will give you an insight into growing your customer base"

	"The human mind is like a sizzling-hot frying pan of associations- throw a handful of seeds in there and they'll explode into new ideas like popcorn. Every note is the seed of an idea, reminding you of what you already know and already think about a subject"

Every idea has an "essence": the heart and soul of what it is trying to communicate.

	Einstein famously summarized his revolutionary new theory of physics with the equation E=mc2

If he can distill his thinking into such equation you can surely summarize the main points in your notes

Ask yourself:
 "How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?"

Think of yourself as a *giver* of notes!!!


### Express: Show Your Work

Capturing, Organizing, and Distilling are made for one ultimate purpose: **Sharing your Ideas, Stories, Knowledge**

A common challenge for people who are curious and love to learn is that we can fall into the habit of continuously force-feeding ourselves more and more information, but never actually take the next step and apply it.

Tons of research - No own proposal
Untold business Case Studies - never pitch one potential client

Information becomes *knowledge* only when we put it to use. 
You Gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works
until you do, it's just a theory!

EVALUATE - SHARE - TEACH - RECORD - POST - LOBBY - PUBLISH - SPEAK - PRESENT - PERFORM - PRODUCE - WRITE - DRAW - INTERPRET - CRITIQUE - TRANSLATE (acts of expression)
These all draw on outside sources for raw material, involve a practical process of refinement over time, and they all end up making an impact on someone or something that matters to you.

IT IS ALWAYS A WORK IN PROGRESS

NO NEED TO WAIT TO GET STARTED

ALL YOU NEED IS A SLIGHTLY MORE INTENTIONAL AND DELIBERATE WAY TO MANAGE THAT INFORMATION
