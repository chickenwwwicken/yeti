## CAPTURE: Keep What Resonates

	EVERYTHING NOT SAVED WILL BE LOST. -NINTENDO "QUIT SCREEN" MESSAGE

It's clear that we need food and water to survive. 
What may not be so clear is that we need information to live:
- to maintain relationships and cooperate with others
- to make wise decisions that further our interests

It's important to understand that the information that you consume must have the same importance as the food you consume too.

You are free to cultivate your ideas in your "knowledge garden", filtering the info stream and get the best ones.

A garden is only as good as its seeds.

What do you do with all the content from different sources that you consume?

#### Building a Private Collection of Knowledge

For Taylor Swift, writing songs is not a discrete activity that she can do only at certain times and in certain places. It is a side effect of the way her mind works. Capitalizing on the excitement of her getting the idea and see it all the way through.

It's not a matter of having enough raw talent. Talent has to be channeled and developed in order to become more than a momentary spark.

	Innovation and impact don't happen by accident or chance.
	Creativity depends on a Creative Process

### Creating a Knowledge Bank: How to Generate Compounding Interest from Your Thoughts

Knowing how you are going to be putting ideas to use gives you a powerful lens for seeing which ones are worth the trouble of writing down.

- Songwriters are known for compiling "hook books" full of lyrics and musical riffs
- Software engineers build "code libraries" so useful bits of code are easy to access
- Lawyers keep "case files" with details from past cases they might want to refer to
- Marketers maintain "swipe files" with examples of compelling ads they might want to draw from

Knowledge shows up today as "content", not just books or philosophy watever.
Knowledge isn't always "out there"
Knowledge capture is about mining the richness of the reading you are doing and the life you are living

#Knowledge_asset =  anything that can be used in the future to solve problem, save time, illuminate a concept, or learn from past experience.

#External_Knowledge:

- Highlights : From books or Youtube 
- Quotes
- Bookmarks : links to content or websites, favorite tweets
- Voice Memos 
- Meeting Notes : Notes on phonecalls
- Images
- Takeaways : Lessons learnt from courses and connections to stuff you do

#Internal_Knowledge : 

- Stories : Stuff you have lived or someone else
- Insights : Realizations you have
- Memories : Experiences from you life
- Reflection : Lessons and thoughts
- Musings : Random "shower ideas"

The meaning of a thought, insight, or memory often isn't immediately clear.
You need to write it, revisit them and view them from a different perspective.

### What *Not* to keep

- Sensitive information like taxes, gov documents, passwords
- Types of documents that use other apps like Illustrator or Photoshop
- Very very large Files
- Collaborative Files

### Nobel Approach to Capturing

"[[Favorite 12 Problems]]" with [[Richard Feynman]]

How could one person make so many contributions across so many areas? 

	"You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit!"

This cross-disciplinary approach allowed him to make connections across seemingly unrelated subjects while continuing to follow his sense of curiosity

"What are the questions you have always been the most interested in?"

## Capture Criteria

Once identifying the questions you want your second brain to answer, 
What are the most useful information pieces for this?

First instinct might be to save the article entirely, but its too long...
saving it entirely will make you have to reread it

Realizing that in any piece of content, the *value* *is* *not* *evenly* *distributed*  There's always certain parts that are especially interesting, helpful. or valuable to you. 

__Extract only the most relevant rich material and save it in a note__

Dont save entire shit! Select the best parts!

The best curators are picky about what they allow into their collections, and you should be too. 


#### Capture Criteria # 1 : Does it inspire me?

Keep a collection of inspiring photos, ideas, stories, songs. 

#### Capture Criteria # 2 : Is it Useful?

#Carpenters are known for keeping odds and ends in a corner of their workshop-- a variety of nails and washers, scraps of lumber cut off from larger planks, and #random bits of metal and wood. It costs nothing to keep these "offcuts" around, and surprisingly often they end up being the crucial missing piece in a future project.

Keep a collection of statistics, research findings or helpful diagrams.

#### Capture Criteria # 3 : Is it Personal?

Collection of your own thoughts, reflections, memories (journaling) 
 No one else has access to the wisdom you've personally gained from a lifetime of conversations, mistakes, victories and lessons learned.
 No one else values the small moments of your days quite like you do.

Saving screenshots of messages sent between #friends  and #family 
Small moments of warmth and humor!
[[Moi]], [[Puki]], [[Cachis]], [[Fede]], [[Yis]], [[Alex]], [[momo]], [[Beto]], [[Toni]]


#### Capture Criteria # 4 : Is It Surprising?

We have a natural bias as humans to seek evidence that confirms what we already believe, phenomenon called #confirmation_bias

[[Claude Shannon]] #information_theorist : 
She paved the way for modern technology and had a simple definition for "information":
"That which surprises you"

If you already know it, why take note of it?

Our ability to capture ideas from anywhere takes us in a different direction: we can train ourselves to take in information from different sources instead of immediately jumping to conclusions. 


	Emotions Organize rather than disrupt rational thinking

Our intuitive mind learns, and responds, even without our conscious awareness.
