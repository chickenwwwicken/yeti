## ORGANIZE : Save For Actionability

*Be regular and orderly in your life so that you may be violent and original in your work*
#GustavFlaubert  - French Novelist

*THE BOX* approach :  comes from having a box of files - could be called *THE VAULT* approach.
Setting an Intention that's gonna be the mantra of each of the projects in the box
These could be #GOALS or #MANTRA and could be 1 or more.

	"We don't need complex, sophisticated systems to be able to produce complex, sophisticated works."

#### The Cathedral Effect : Designing a Space for Your Ideas

Studies have shown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking. 
- High Ceilings = More Abstract
- Low Ceilings = More Concrete

__Second Brain is not a TOOL it is an ENVIRONMENT!__

__Garden Full of Familiar, Winding Pathways, and Secret Corners__

__Requires Caretaker__

#### Organizing For Action!

__Organize by Project__


## P.A.R.A. #PARA

There are FOUR main areas of info in our lives :

- Projects : Main Unit of Organization
- Areas : of Your Life you are Responsible for
- Resources : Personal Library of References/Facts/Inspiration
- Archives : 

These Four categories are universal , 
- Encompassing *any* kind of information , 
- From *any* source , 
- In *any* format , 
- For *any* purpose 

The idea is to not use only one *software* but to use only one *organizing system*

{Project} Folders will be the SAME NAME in every app or software

### PROJECT : What I'm Working on Right Now #Projects

**Projects** : Short-term efforts in your work or life that you're working on now.\\

Projects have a couple of features that make them an ideal way to organize modern work. 

- Have a beginning and an #END 
- Take place during a specific period of time and then #FINISH
- Have a specific, clear outcome that needs to happen in order for them to #COMPLETE

- Artits have paintings
- dancers dances
- musician songs
- poet peom
- (Discrete chunks of Work)
- **Project Centric approach**

**Workflow**\\
"A Project is identified ; a team is assembled ; it works together for precisely as long as is needed to complete the task ; then the team disbands..."

**Type of Projects**\\

 - *Personal* *Projects* = 
	 - sdfasd
	 - asd
	 - asdf
	 - asdf
- *Projects at Work* = 
	- asdf
	- asdf
	- asdf
	- asdf
- *Side Projects* = 
	- asdfas
	- asdf
	- asdf
	- asd

### AREA :  #Areas

**Areas** : What I'm committed to Over Time \\ 
 - Not everything is a project
- Finances doesn't have a definite end date.
- No Final Objective
- Both Personal and Professional


While there is no GOAL , There is a #Standard that you want to uphold .\\

[[aaSalud]] = Excercise 5 Times x Week
[[aaFinanzas]] = Provide
[[aaFamilia]] = 1 x Month

### RESOURCE:  #Resources

**Resources** : Things I Want to Reference in The Future

2. Topics you are interested in gathering information about

- What topics are you #interesting in?
- What subjects are you researching ?
- What useful information do you want to #Reference ?
- Which #hobbies or #passions ?

Can also think of them as **research or reference materials**
