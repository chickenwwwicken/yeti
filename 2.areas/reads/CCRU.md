	"CCRU retrochronically triggers itself from October 1995, where it uses Sadie Plant as a screen and Warwick University as a temporary habitat . ... CCRU feeds on graduate students + malfunctioning academic (Nick Land) + independent researchers + .... At degree-O CCRU is the name of a door in the Warwick University Philosophy Department . Here it is now officially said that CCRU 'does not , has not , and will never exist' . "

Sadie Plant leaves 1997

	CCRU's contributions to Syzygy had taken the form of nightly rituals dedicated to what they openly called 'demons' . Night after night , the theme of 'twins' and 'twinning' recurred . At this time , part of me still thought that this was still some kind of art prank . But thee nightly rituals and readings were performed with what appeared to be total seriousness . And every day , after the official events finished, there were long, involved discussions that lasted deep into the night . None of the CCRU controllers ever seemed to sleep . 

	They claimed that ordinary social reality maintained the power of what they called 'Atlantean White Magic' , a kind of elite conspiracy which they said had secretly controlled the planet for millennia. They claimed to traffick with demons who had told them many secrets drawn from a 'Lemurian' tradition of 'time-sorcery' that contained within itself everything that was and will be . Lemuria was supposedly an ancient sorcerous culture populated by nonhuman beings . 

	Trent uses the term "hyperstition" for "cybernetic" belief systems such as these. "It's not a simple matter of true or false with hyperrstitious systems. Belief here doesn't have a simply passive quality . The situation is closer to the modern phenomenon of hype than to religious belief as we'd ordinarily think about it . Hype actually makes things happen , and uses belief as a positive power . Just because it's not 'real' now, doesn't mean it won't be real at some point in the future . And once it's real , in a sense , it's always been." One key area of Cybergoth activity is their response to the so-called "Millennium Bug" (the computer glitch caused by the coding convention renders as two , rather than for, digits)

"Time is just transcendental object , something that only exist in human minds. there are no weeks in nature" "The only true way to measure time is through Decay and entropy" "because all ideas exist outside of time they've always existed" "it's true now because it's true in the future"

Humans are the sex organs of the machine world

Guillome Verdom - former quantum computing + founder of accelerationist movement

movimiento acceleracionista cree en que la tecnologia va a resolver todos los problemas de la humanidad, tambien es un movimiento consciente de las hipersticiones. 

	there are very good reasons to believe that the memetics of the fashionable intellectual doomer era have been harmful to individuals, culture, and progress. We align with accelerationism from the perspective of recognizing the awesomeness of the forces guiding our world, of the civilizational thermodynamic process we're a part of. - anonymous post from e/acc forum

## Cultural logic of Late Capitalism
![[Pasted image 20240618154425.png]]
Jameson argues

	posmodernism is a cultural meme that could only exist because of late capitalism
*postmodernism:*
the death of truth - a late 20th century style and concept in the arts, architecture, and criticism that represents a departure from modernism and has at its heart a general distrust of grand theories and ideologies as well as a problematical relationshyip with any notion of "art"
