In Greek mythology, the Garden of the Hesperides is an orchard belonging to Hera, the queen of the gods, which produces golden apples. According to myth, Gaia, the Earth goddess, gifted Hera with branches bearing golden apples as a wedding present when she married Zeus.

The garden is often described as being located in the western part of the world, near the Atlas mountains in Africa. It is guarded by Ladon, a hundred-headed, never sleeping dragon. The golden apples were planted from the fruit branches given to Hera by Gaia.

Where either a single apple tree or a grove grows, producing golden apples that grant immortality when eaten. The Hesperides were given the task of tending to the grove, but occasionally picked apples from it themselves. 

In the myth of the Judgement of Paris, it was from the Garden that Eris, Goddess of Discord, obtained the Apple of Discord, which led to the Trojan War.

Hesperides were the nymphs of evening and golden light of sunsets, who were the "Daughters of the Evening" or "Nymphs of the West". They were also called the Atlantides.
