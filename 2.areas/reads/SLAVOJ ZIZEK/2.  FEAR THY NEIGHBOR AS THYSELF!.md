### *Allegro moderato - Adagio*

#### The Politics of Fear
Today's predominant mode of politics is post-political biopolitics - an awesome example of theoretical jargon which , however , can easily be unpacked : 'post-political' is a politics which claims to leave behind old ideological struggles and , instead , focus on expert management and administration , while 'bio-politics' designates the regulation of the security and welfare of human lives as its primary goal . It is clear how these two dimensions overlap : once one renounces big ideological causes , what remains is only the efficient administration of life ... *almost* only that . That is to say , with the depoliticised , socially objective , expert administration and coordination of interests as the zero level of politics , the only way too introduce passion into this field , to actively mobilise people , is through fear , a basic constituent of today's subjectivity . For this reason , bio-politics is ultimately a politics of fear , it focuses on defence from potential victimisation or harassment . 

	post-politico significa que no se luchan causas ideologicas, si no que se toman decisiones en base a la administracion de intereses x 'expertos' 
	bio-politica pone la vida humana como prioridad. 
	cual es el problema? - cuando ya no hay causas ideologicas, la unica manera de mobilizar masas es a traves del miedo. 

This is what separates a radical emancipatory politics from our political status quo . We're talking here not about the difference between two visions , or sets of axioms, but about the difference between politics based on a set of universal axioms and a politics which renounces the very constitutive dimension of the political  , since it resorts to fear as its ultimate mobilising principle : fear of immigrants , fear of crime , fear of godless sexual depravity , fear of the excessive state itself , with its burden of high taxation , fear of ecological catastrophe , fear of harassment. Political correctness is the exemplary liberal form of the politics of fear . Such a (post-)politics always relies on the manipulation of a paranoid ochlos or multitude : it is the frightening rallying of frightened people . 

	emancipatory - giving people social or political freedom and rights
	axiom - a statement or principle that is generally accepted to be true, but need not be so. 
	
	la post-politica de hoy en dia no se puede comparar con politicas radicales emancipatorias por que este renuncia a los axiomas (valores) de cualquier tipo de politica, este tipo de (post-)politica depende de la manipulacion de una multitud paranoica: 'it is the frightening rallying of frightened people'

Thus the big event of 2006 was when anti-immigration politics went mainstream and finally cut the umbilical cord that had connected it to far-right fringe parties . From France to Germany , from Austria to Holland , in the new spirit of pride in cultural and historical identity , the main parties now found it acceptable to stress that immigrants are guests who must accommodate themselves to the cultural values that define the host society - 'It is our country , love it or leave it' 

	En 2006 politicas de anti-immigracion se vuelven populares, Europa dice 'este es nuestro territorio, o te aclimatas o te aclichingas' refiriendose a que personas que lleguen a un pais se tienen que acoplar a los valores culturales del pais al que hayan llegado

Today's liberal tolerance towards others , the respect of otherness and openness towards it, is counterpointed by an obsessive fear of harassment . In short , the Other is just fine, but only insofar as his presence is not intrusive , insofar as this Other is not really other ...
In a strict homology with the paradoxical structure of the previous chapter's chocolate laxative , tolerance coincides with its opposite . 

	harassment - behaviour that annoys or upsets someone
	la tendencia liberal hacia la tolerancia del 'otro' choca con el miedo obsesivo al acoso de este 'otro', 'dont scare the hoes' vs. 'si ya me conocen p que me invitan'

My duty to be tolerant towards the Other effectively means that I should not get too close to him , intrude on his space . In other words, I should respect his *intolerance* of my over-proximity .

	mi deber sera respetar su intolerancia hacia mi cercania

What increasingly emerges as the central human right in late capitalist society is the *right not to be harassed* , which is a right to remain at a safe distance from others . 

	mas y mas emerge el derecho de no ser acosado como el derecho humano central en el capitalismo tardio.

Post-political biopolitics also has two aspects which cannot but appear to belong to two opposite ideological spaces : that of the reduction of humans to 'bare life' , to *Homo sacer* , that so-called sacred being who is the object of expert caretaking knowledge , but is excluded , like prisoners at Guantanamo or Holocaust victims , from all rights; and that of respect for the vulnerable Other brought to an extreme through an attitude of narcissistic subjectivity which experiences the self as vulnerable , constantly exposed to a multitude of potential 'harassments' . Can there be a more emphatic contrast than the one between respect for the Other's vulnerability and the reduction of the Other to mere 'bare life ' regulated by administrative knowledge ? But what if these two stances none the less spring from a single root? What if they are two aspects of one and the same underlying attitude? What if they coincide in what one is tempted to designate as the contemporary case of the Hegelian ' infinite judgment'  which asserts the identity of opposite ? What these two poles share is precisely the underlying refusal of any higher causes , the notion that the ultimate goal of our lives is life itself . This is why there is no contradiction between the respect for the vulnerable Other and the readiness to justify torture , the extreme expression of treating individuals as *Homini sacer*.

	post-politica adopta dos aspectos contrastantes en la cual entender al 'otro'; la reduccion del 'otro' a subhumano sin derechos humanos, y el respeto al vulnerable 'otro' en base a un sentido narcisista-subjetivo de que es tambien vulnerable a muchos potenciales 'acosos'. 

In *The End of Faith* , Sam Harris defends the use of torture in exceptional cases (but , of course , everyone who defends torture defends it as an exceptional measure - nobody seriously advocates torturing a small hungry child who has stolen a chocolate bar ) . His defence is based on the distinction between our instinctive abhorrence of witnessing the torture of suffering of an individual with our own eyes , and our abstract knowledge of mass suffering : it is much more difficult for us to torture an individual than to sanction from afar the dropping of a bomb which would cause the more painful deaths of thousands .

	en su libro Sam Harris defiende el uso de tortura basado en la distincion entre nuestro instinto de desplacer al presenciar una tortura a un individuo contra nuestro conocimiento abstracto de sufrimiento de masas : mas dificil torturar a un individuo que decidir de lejos a donde tirar una bomba. 

We are thus all caught in a kind of ethical illusion , parallel to perceptual illusions . The ultimate cause of these illusions is that , although our power of abstract reasoning has developed immensely , our emotional-ethical responses remain conditioned by age-old instinctual reactions of sympathy to suffering and pain that is witnessed directly . This is why shooting someone point-blank is for most of us much more repulsive than pressing a button that will kill a thousand people we cannot see : 

	mientras nuestro pensamiento abstracto a evolucionado considerablemente, nuestro sentido etico-emocional sigue condicionado por reacciones instintivas de simpatia al sufrimiento. matar a alguien es mucho mas repulsivo que picar un boton y matar a mil personas.

   Given what many of us believe about the exigencies of our war on terrorism , the practice of torture, in certain circumstances , would seem to be not only permissible but necessary . Still , it does not seem any more acceptable , in ethical terms , than it did before . The reasons for this are , I trust , every bit as neurological as those that give rise to the moon illusion . It may be time to take out our rulers and hold them up to the sky. 

No wonder that Harris refers to Alan Dershowitz and his legitimisation of torture . In order to suspend this evolutionary conditioned vulnerability to the physical display of others' suffering , Harris imagines an ideal ' truth pill' , an effective torture equivalent to decaffeinated coffee or diet Coke :

  a drug that would deliver both the instruments of torture and the instrument of their utter concealment . The action of the pill would be to produce transitory paralysis and transitory misery of a kind that no human being would willingly submit to a second time . Imagine how we torturers would feel if, after giving this pill to captive terrorists , each lay down for what appeared to be an hour's nap only to arise and immediately confess everything he knows about the workings of his organization . Might we not be tempted to call it a 'truth pill' in the end ?

	una droga que tiene los instrumentos de tortura y el instrumento de encubrir la misma, la llamariamos la pastilla de la verdad. 

The very first words - 'a drug that would deliver both the instruments of torture and the instrument of their utter concealment' - introduce the typically postmodern logic of chocolate laxative : the torture imagined here is like decaf coffee - we get the desired result without having to suffer unpleasant side effects . At the notorious Serbsky Institute in Moscow , the psychiatric outlet of the KGB , they did invent just such a drug with which to torture dissidents : an injection into the prisoner's heart zone which slowed his pulse and caused terrifying anxiety . Viewed from the outside , the prisoner seemed just to be dozing , while in fact he was living a nightmare . 

	En el Instituto Serbsky de Moscow, inventaron una inyeccion que va directo a la zona del corazon, esta alenta el pulso causando terrible ansiedad. Desde afuera parece que solo esta apendejado, pero por adentro esta viviendo una pesadilla.

Harris violates his own rules when he focuses on September 11 , and his critique of Chomsky . Chomsky's point is precisely that there is a hypocrisy in tolerating the abstract-anonymous killing of thousands , while condemning individual cases of the violation of human rights . Why should Kissinger , when he ordered the carpet bombing of Cambodia that led to the deaths of tens of thousands , be less of a criminal than those responsible for the Twin Towers collapse ? Is it not because we are victims of an 'ethical illusion' ? The horror of September 11 was presented in detail in the media , but al-Jazeera TV was condemned for showing shots of the results of US bombing in Fallujah and condemned for complicity with the terrorists . 

	Chomsky dice que hay hipocresia en tolerar el asesinato anonimo-abstracto de miles, cuando condenamos casos individuales de violacion de derechos humanos.

There is, however , a much more disquieting prospect at work here : the proximity of the tortured subject which causes sympathy and makes torture unacceptable is not the victim's mere physical proximity , but , at its most fundamental , the proximity of the Neighbour , with all the Judeo-Christian-Freudian weight of this term , the proximity of the thing which , no matter how far away it is physically , is always by definition 'too close' . What Harris is aiming at with his imagined 'truth pill' is nothing less than *the abolition of the dimension of the Neighbour* . 

**The tortured subject is no longer a Neighbour  , but an object whose pain is neutralised , reduced to a property that has to be dealt with in a rational utilitarian calculus (so much pain is tolerable if it prevents a much greater amount of pain) . What disappears here is the abyss of the infinity that pertains to a subject .

It is thus significant that the book which argues for torture is also a book entitled *The End of Faith*** - not in the obvious sense of , 'you see, it is only our belief in God , the divine injunction to love your neighbour , that ultimately prevents us from torturing people! ' , but in a much more radical sense . Another subject (and, ultimately, the subject as such) is for Lacan not something directly given , but a 'presupposition' , something presumed, and object of belief - how can i ever be sure that what i see in front of me is another subject , not a flat biological machine lacking depth ? 


#### *The Neighbour Thing* 

This presupposed subject is thus not another human being with a rich inner life filled with personal stories which are self narrated in order to acquire a meaningful experience of life , since such a person cannot ultimately be an enemy . 'An enemy is someone whose story you have not heard.' What better literary example of this thesis than Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* Shelley does something that a conservative would never have done . In the central part of her book , she allows the monster to speak for himself , to tell the story from his own perspective . Her choice expresses the liberal attitude to freedom of speech at its most radical : everyone's POV should be heard . In *Frankenstein* , the monster is not a 'thing' , a horrible object no one dares to confront ; he is fully *subjectivised* . Mary Shelley moves inside his mind and asks what it is like to be labelled , defined, oppressed , excommunicated, even physically distorted by society . The ultimate criminal is thus allowed to present himself as the ultimate victim . The monstrous murderer reveals himself to be a deeply hurt and desperate individual , yearning for company and love . 

There is , however, a clear limit to this procedure : is one also ready to affirm that Hitler was an enemy because his story was not heard? In *Lenin's Tomb*, David Remnick reports his attempts , during his visit to Moscow in 1988 , to meet Lazar Kaganovich , the last surviving member of Stalin's inner circle , who directed the collectivisation programme of 1929-33 and was responsible for untold destruction and suffering . At the age of ninety-plus , he was living a secluded life in a lonely apartment . What fascinated Remnick was the prospect of seeing a truly evil person : 

  Did Kaganocich still believe ? I wanted to know . Did he feel any guilt , any shame ? And what did he think of Gorbachev , the current general secretary ? But that wasn't it , really . Mostly I wanted just to sit in the same room with Kaganovich , to see what an evil man looked like , to know what he did , what books he kept around.'

What , in all probability , Temnick would have encountered had he succeeded would have been a frail , benevolent old man stuck in his dreams . When , in the 1960's , Svetlana Stalin emigrated to the US through India and wrote her memoirs , she presented Stalin 'from inside' as a warm father and caring leader , with most of the mass murders imposed on him by his evil collaborators . Lavrenty Beria in particular . Later, Beria's son Sergo wrote a memoir presenting his father as a warm family man who simply followed Stalin's orders and secretly tried to limit the damage . Georgy Malenkov's son Andrei also told his story , describing his father , Stalin's successor , as an honest hard worker , always afraid for his life . Hannah Arendt was right : these figures were not personifications of sublime Byronesque demonic evil : the gap between their intimate experience and the horror of their acts was immense . The experience that we hace of our lives from within , the story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing , is fundamentally a lie - the truth lies outside , in what we do . 

One thing that never ceases to surprise the naive ethical consciousness is how the very humanity and gentle care for the members of their own group.  Isn't it strange that the same soldier who slaughtered innocent civilians was ready to sacrifice his life for his unit? That the commander who ordered the shooting of hostages can that same evening write a letter to his family full of sincere love ? This limitation of our ethical concern to a narrow circle seems to run counter to our spontaneous insight that we are all humans  , with the same basic hopes , fears and pains , and therefore the same justified claim to respect and dignity , Consequently , those who constrain the scope of their ethical concern are in a profound sense inconsistent , 'hypocritical' even . To put it in Habermasian terms, they are involved in a pragmatic contradiction , since they violate the ethical norms which sustain their own speech community . Tefusing the same basic ethical rights to those outside our community as to those inside it is something that does not come naturally to a human being . It is a violation of our spontaneous ethical proclivity . It involves brutal represssion and self-denial . 

When , after the fall of communism , the East German softdissident writer Stephan Hermlin was reproached for writing texts and poems back in the 1950s that celebrated Stalin , he replied with furious indignity that in those years in Europe the name 'Stalin' simply stood for inspiration to freedom and justice , and had nothing to do with the horrible things which were 'secretly' taking place in the Soviet Union . This excuse , of course , is all to slick and easy : one need not know  the truth about the Stalinist terror in order to suspect that something was hideously wrong in Stalinism . Reading public texts - the official reports from the show trials , the attacks on enemies , the official panegyrics to Stalin and other leaders - should have been more than enough . In a way , everything one needs to know was already clear from these . This is why the truly surprising hypocrisy was the readiness of the Western communist observers to perceive the Stalinist accusations as a true psychological fact about the accused . In a letter to Walter Benjamin from 1938 , Theodor Adorno reports a conversation he had with the left-leaning composer Hans Eisler in New York : 

  I listened with not a little patience to his feeble defence of the Moscow trials , and with considerable disgust to the joke he cracked about the murder of Bukharin . He claims to have known the latter in Moscow , telling me that Bukharin's conscience was already so bad that he could not even look him honestly in the eyes.

Eisler's psychological blindness is staggering here : he misreads Bukharin's terror - his fear of contact with foreigners when he knows that he is under observation and close to arrest - as an inner guilt feeling for the crimes he was accused of  . How are we to understand this alongside the fact that the cultural products of high Stalinism were perceived by many in the West as the most authentic expression of authentic morality , one exuding a warm humanism and a faith in man ( recall the reception in the West of Mark Donskoi's Gorky trilogy)? Perhaps one should move from reproaching the naivety of Western fellowtravellers about the horrors of the Stalinist Soviet Union to a more Deleuzian notion of a contingent  series intersecting and generating totally disparate meanings , like a science-fiction story in which scientists discover that the explosion which , in the Bible , signals the divine message , was effectively the visual trace of a terrible catastrophe that destroyed a flourishing alien civilisation . That is to say , the difficult thing to accept is that the horrors out of which the Gorky trilogy grew in no way undermine the authenticity of its effect on a Western of even a Russian audience . 

When the United Airlines Flight 93 and three other planes were skyjacked on 9/11 , it is significant that the gist of the phone calls to their closest relatives from the passengers who knew they were about to die was 'I love you' . Martin Amis emphasised the Paulinian point that all that ultimately matters is love : 'Love is an abstract nown , something nebulous . And yet love turns out to be the only part of us that is solid , as the world turns upside down and the screen goes black.' However , a suspicion remains here : is this desperate confession of love not something of a sham , the same kind of fakerry as the sudden turn to God and prayer of someone who suddenly faces the danger or proximity of death - a hypocritical opportunistic move born of fear , not of true conviction ? Why should there be more truth in what we do in such desperate moments? Is it not rather that , in such moments , the survival instinct makes us *betray our desire* ? In this sense , deathbed conversions or confessions of love are sacrifices of desire . According to numerous memoirs, many of the condemned at Stalinist show trials faced the firing squad professing their innocence and their love for Stalin , a pathetic gesture aimed at redeeming their image in the eyes of the big Other . In this same vein , one cannot but be stricken by how , in their intimate correspondence , Ethel and Julius Rosenberg denied they were Soviet spies , playing innocent victims of an FBI plot , although , to the embarrassment of their defenders , recent documents prove that Julius at least was a spy (albeit a lower-level one than the prosecution claimed). The weird thing is that when one reads their intimate documents now , even knowing that he was indeed a spy , one still cannot escape them impression of utter sincerity, as if Rosenberg had convinced himself of his innocence . This fact becomes stranger still when one bears in mind that , if he really believed in the Soviet Union , why , then , shouldn't he be spying for it , and be proud of it ? (This , incidentally , brings us to what would have been a true ethical act : imagine a wife phoning her husband in the last seconds of her life to tell him : 'Just wanted to let you know that our marriage was a sham  , that I cannot stand the sight of you ...') 

Those Western leftists who heroically defied anti-communist hysteria in their own countries and did so with the utmost sincerity provide other instances of the tragic produced by the Cold War . They were prepared to go to prison for their communist convictions and in defense of the Soviet Union . Isn't it the very illusory nature of  their belief that makes their subjective stance so tragically sublime ? The miserable reality of the Stalinist Soviet Union gives their inner conviction a fragile beauty . This leads us to a radical and unexpected conclusion : it is not enough to say that we are dealing here with a tragically misplaced ethical conviction , with a blind trust that avoids confronting the miserable , terrifying reality of its ethical point of reference . What if , on the contrary , such a blindness, such a violent exclusionary gesture of refusing to see, such a disavowal of reality, such a fetishist attitude of 'I know very well that things are horrible in the Soviet Union, but I believe none the less in Soviet socialism' is the innermost constituent of *every* ethical stance?

Kant was already well aware of this paradox when he deployed his notion of enthusiasm for the French Revolution in his *Conflict of Faculties* (1975) . The Revolution's true significance does not reside in what actually went on in Paris - much of which was terrifying and included outbursts of murderous passion - but in the enthusiastic response that the events in Paris generated in the eyes of sympathetic observers all around Europe : 

  The recent Revolution of a people which is rich in spirit , may well either fail or succeed, accumulate misery and atrocity , but nevertheless arouses in the heart of all spectators (who are not themselves caught up in it) a  taking of sides according to desires which borders on enthusiasm and which , since its very expression was not without danger, can only have been caused by a moral disposition within the human race. 

To translate this into Lacanian language , the real event, the very dimension of the Real, was not in the immediate reality of the violent events in Paris, but in how this reality appeared to observers and in the hopes thus awakened in them . The reality of what went on in Paris belongs to the temporal dimension of empirical history: the sublime image that generated enthusiasm belongs to eternity ...

*Mutatis mutandis*, the same applies for the Western admirers of the Soviet Union . The Soviet experience of 'building socialism in one country' certainly did 'accumulate misery and atrocity' , but it nevertheless aroused enthusiasm in the heart of the spectators (who were not themselves caught up in it) ... The question here is: does *every* ethics have to rely on such a gesture of fetishist disavowal? Is even the most universal ethics not obliged to draw a line and ignore some sort of suffering? What about animals slaughtered for our consumption? Who among us would be able to continue eating pork chops after visiting a factory farm in which pigs are half-blind and cannot even properly walk. but are just fattened to be killed? And what about say , torture and suffering of millions we know about, but choose to ignore? Imagine the effect of having to watch a snuff movie portraying what goes on thousands of times a day around the world : brutal acts of torture, the picking out of eyes , the crushing of testicles - the list cannot bear recounting . Would the watcher be able to continue going on as usual? Yes, but only if he or she were able somehow to forget - in an act which suspended symbolic efficiency - what had been witnessed . This forgetting entails a gesture of what is called fetishist disavowal : 'I know , but i don't wanna know that i know, so I don't know.' I know it, but I refuse to fully assume the consequences of this knowledge, so that I can continue acting as if I don't know it. 

	fetishist disavowal :
		fetish : a sexual interest in an object or a part of the body other than the sexual organs.
		disavowal : the action of saying that you know nothing abouth something, or that you have no responsibility for or connection with something. 

It begins to come clear that every ethics may well have to rely on just this gesture of fetishist disavowal. Even the apparently obvious exception, the Buddhist ethics of solidarity with every living being, falls into this picture. After all, what Buddhism offers as a solution is a universalised indifference - a learning of how to withdraw from too much empathy. This is why Buddhism can so easily turn into the very opposite of universal compassion : the advocacy of a ruthless military attitude , which is what the fate of Zen Buddhism aptly demonstrates. 

To wonder at this fact is not a proper philosophical attitude. That is to say , what if that which appears as an inconsistency, as the failure to draw all the consequences from one's ethical attitude, is, on the contrary, its positive condition of possibility ? What if such an exclusion of some form of otherness from the scope of our ethical concerns is consubstantial with the very founding gesture of ethical universality, so that the more universal our explicit ethics is , the more brutal the underlying exclusion is? 

	the more universal our ethics, the more we disemvowel ?

What the Christian all-inclusive attitude (recall St Paul's famous 'there are no men or women, no Jews and Greeks') involves is a thorough exclusion of those who do not accept inclusion into the Christian community. In other 'particularistic' religions (and even in Islam, in spite of its global expansionism), there is a place for others: they are tolerated, even if they are looked upon with condescension. The Christian motto 'All men are brothers', however, also means that those who do not accept brotherhood *are not men*. In the early years of the Iranian revolution, Khomeini played on the same paradox when he claimed, in an interview for the Western press, that the Iranian revolution was the most humane in all of history: not a single person was killed by the revolutionaries. When the surprised journalist asked about the death penalties publicised in the media, Khomeini calmly replied: 'Those that we killed were not men, but criminal dogs!'

Christians usually praise themselves for overcoming the Jewish exclusivist notion of the Chosen People and encompassing the entirety of humanity. The catch is that, in their very insistence that they are the Chosen People with a privileged direct link to God, Jews accept the humanity of the other people who celebrate their false gods, while Christian universalism tendentiously excludes non-believers from the very universality of humankind. 

So what about the opposite gesture - such as that made by the French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas - of abandoning the claim to sameness that underlies universality, and replacing it by a respect for otherness? There is, a Levinasian figure of the Neighbour as the imponderable Other who deserves our unconditional respect. That is, the imponderable Other as enemy, the enemy who is the absolute Other and no longer the 'honourable enemy', but someone whose very reasoning is foreign to us, so that no authentic encounter with him in battle is possible. Although Levinas did not have this dimension in mind, the radical ambiguity, the traumatic character of the Neighbour makes it easy to understand how Levinas's notion of the Other prepared the ground ( opened up the space) for it in a way strictly fomologous to the way that Kantian ethics prepared the ground for the notion of diabolical evil. Horrible as it may sound, the Levinasian Other as the abyss of otherness from which the ethical injunction emanates and the Nazi figure of the Jew as the lessthan-human Other-enemy originate from the same source. 

When Freud and Lacan insist on the problematic nature of the basic Judeo-Christian injunction to  'love thy neighbour', they are thus not just making the standard critico-ideological point abouth how every notion of universality is coloured by our particular values and thus implies secret exclusions; they are making a much stronger point on the incompatibility of the Neighbour with the very dimension of universality. What resists universality is the properly *inhuman* dimension of the Neighbour. It is for this reason that finding oneself in the position of the beloved is so violent, traumatic even: being loved makes me feel directly the gap between what I am as a determinate being and the unfathomable X in me which causes love. Lacan's definition of love ('Love is giving something one doesn't have ...') has to be supplemented with : '... to someone who doesn't want it.' Indeed, are we aware that Yeats's wellknown lines describe one of the most claustrophobic constellations that one can imagine?

  Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths, 
  Enwrought with golden and silver light,
  The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
  Of night and light and the half-light,
  I would spread the cloths under your feet: 
  But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
  I have spread my dreams under your feet, 
  Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. 

In short, as the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze put it, *If you're trapped in the dream of the other, you're fucked!* ; or, as Neil Gaiman, the author of the graphic novel *The Sandman*, wrote in a memorable passage:

 Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life... You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love.

In the last years of his life, Soviet film director Andrei Tarkovsky lived in Stockholm, working on *The Sacrifice*. He was given an office in the same building in which Ingmar Berman, who at that time still lived in Stockholm, had his. Although the two directors had deep respect and supreme mutual admiration, they never met, but carefully avoided each other, as if their direct encounter would have been too painful and doomed to fail on account of the very proximity of their universes. They invented and respected their own code of discretion. 

#### *The Violence of Language* 

So why, today, this fear of the over-proximity of the Other as a subject of desire? Why the need to decaffeinate the Other, to deprive him or her of their raw substance of jouissance? I suspect this is a reaction to the disintegration of the protective symbolic walls that kept others at a proper distance. What we lack in our culture where brutal self-confessions are countered by the politically correct fear of harassment which keeps the Other at bay is the spirit best expressed by Gore Vidal. Vidal gave the perfect answer to a vulgarly intrusive journalist who had asked him point-blank whether his first sexual partner was a man or a woman: 'I was too polite to ask', he said. 

Nowhere is this disintegration of the protective walls of civility more palpable than in the clashes of different cultures. In the autumn of 2005, the West was captivated by an explosion of vilence which threatened to spill over into a literal clash of civilsations: the widespread demonstrations in Arab countries against caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad published in *Jyllands-Posten*, a small-circulation Danish newspaper. The first thing to be noted, so obvious that as a rule it's overlooked, is that the vast majority of the thousands who felt offended by and demonstrated against the cartoons had not even *seen* them. This fact confronts us with another, less attractive, aspect of globalisation: the 'global information village' is the condition of the fact that something which appeared in an obscure daily in Denmark caused a violent stir in distant Muslim countries. It is as if Denmark and Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon and Indonesia really were *neighbouring* countries. Those who understand globalisation as an opportunity for the entire earth to be a unified space of communication, one which brings together all humanity, often fail to notice this dark side of their proposition. Since a Neighbour is, as Freud suspected long ago, primarily a thing, a traumatic intruder, someone whose different way of life (or, rather, way of *jouissance* materialised in its social practices and rituals) disturbs us, throws the balance of our way of life off the rails, when it comes too close, this can also give rise to an aggressive reaction aimed at getting rid of this disturbing intruder. As Peter Sloterdijk put it: 'More communication means at first above all more conflict.' This is why he is right to claim that the attitude of 'understanding-each-other' has to be supplemented by the attitude of 'getting-outof-each-other's-way', by maintaining an appropriate distance, by implementing a new 'code of discretion'.

European civilisation finds it easier to tolerate different ways of life precisely on account of what its critics usually denounce as its weakness and failure, namely the alienation of social life. One of the things alienation means is that distance is woven into the very social texture of everyday life. Even if I live side by side with others, in my normal state I ignore them. I am allowed not to get too close to others. I move in a social space where I interact with others obeying certain 'mechanical' rules, without sharing their inner world. Perhaps the lesson to be learned is that sometimes a dose of alienation is indispensable for peaceful coexistence. Sometimes alienation is not a problem but a solution. 

The Muslim crowds did not react to the Muhammad caricatures as such. They reacted to the complex figure or image of the *West* that they perceived as the attitude behind the caricatures. Those who propose the term 'Occidentalism' as the counterpart to Edward Said's 'Orientalism' are right up to a point: what we get in Muslim countries is a certain ideological vision of the West which distorts Western reality no less, although in a different way, than the Orientalist vision distorts the Orient. What exploded in violence was a web of symbols, images and attitudes, including Western imperialism, godless materialism, hedonism and the suffering of Palestinians, and which became attached to the Danish cartoons. This is why the hatred expanded from the caricatures to Denmark as a country, to Scandinavia , to Europe, and to the West as a whole. A torrent of humiliations and frustrations were condensed into the caricatures. This condensation, it needs to be borne in mind, is a basic fact of language, of constructing and imposing a certain symbolic field. 

This simple and all too obvious reflection on the way in which language works renders problematic the prevalent idea of language and the symbolic order as the medium of reconciliation and mediation, of peaceful coexistence, as opposed to a violent medium of immediate and raw confrontation. In language, instead of exerting direct violence on each other, we are meant to debate, to exchange words, and such an exchange even when it is aggressive, presupposes a minimal recognition of the other party. The entry into language and the renunciation of violence are often understood as two aspects of one and the same gesture: 'Speaking is the foundation and structure of socialization, and happens to be characterized by the renunciation of violence,' as a text by Jean-Marie Muller written for UNESCO tells us. Since man is a 'speaking animal', this means that the renunciation of violence defines the very core of being human: 'it is actually the principles and methods of non-violence ... that constitute the humanity of human beings, the coherence and relevance of moral standards based both on convictions and a sense of responsibility', so that violence is 'indeed a radical perversion of humanity'. Insofar as language gets infected by violence, this occurs under the incluence of contingent 'pathological' circumstances which distort the inherent logic of communication. 

What if , however, humans exceed animals in their capacity for violence precisely because they *speak*? As Hegel was already well aware, there is something violent in the very symbolisation of a thing, which equals its mortification. This violence operates at multiple levels. Language simplifies the designated thing, reducing it to a single feature. It dismembers the thing, destroying its organic unity, treating its parts and properties as autonomous. It inserts the thing into a field of meaning which is ultimately external to it. When we name gold 'gold' , we violently extract a metal from its natural texture, investing into it our dreams of wealth, power, spiritual purity and so on, which have nothing whatsoever to do with the immediate reality of gold. 

Lacan condensed this aspect of language in his notion of the Master-Signifier which 'quilts' and thus holds together a symbolic field. That is to say, for Lacan - at least for his theory of four discourses elaborated in the late 1960s human communication in its most basic constitutive dimension does not involve a space of egalitarian intersubjectivity. It is not 'balanced'. It does not put the participants in symmetric mutually responsible positions where they all have to follow the same rules and justify their claims with reasons. On the contrary, what Lacan indicates with his notion of the discourse of the Master as the first (inaugural, constitutive) form of discourse is that every concrete, 'really existing' space of discourse is ultimately grounded in a violent imposition of a Master-Signifier which is *stricto sensu* 'irrational': it cannot be further grounded in reasons. It is the point at which one can only say that 'the buck stops here'; a point at which, in order to stop the endless regress, somebody has to say, '*It is so because I say it is so!*' Here, Levinas was right to emphasise the fundamentally asymmetrical character of intersubjectivity: there is never a balanced reciprocity in my encountering another subject. The appearance of *egalite* is always discursively sustained by an asymmetric axis of master versus servant, of the bearer of university knowledge versus its object, of a pervert versus a hysteric, and so on. This, of course, runs against the predominant ideological approach to the topic of violence which understands it as 'spontaneous', an approach well exemplified in Muller's starting point is the rejection of all attempts to distinguish between 'good' and 'bad' violence:

  It is essential to define violence in such a way that it cannot be qualified as 'good'. The moment we claim to be able to distinguish 'good' violence from 'bad', we lose the proper use of the word, and get into a muddle. Above all, as soon as we claim to be developing criteria by which to define a supposedly 'good' violence, each of us will find it easy to make use of these in order  to justify our own acts of violence. 

But how can one wholly repudiate violence when struggle and aggression are a part of life? The easy way out is a terminological distinction between the 'aggression' that effectively amounts to a 'life-force' and the 'violence' that is a 'death-force': 'violence', here, is not aggression as such, but its excess which disturbs the normal run of things by desiring always more and more. The task becomes to get rid of this excess. 

Desiring property and power is legitimate insofar as it enables an individual to achieve independence from others. Adversaries in a conflict, however, each have a natural tendency always to demand more. Nothing is enough for them, and they are never satisfied. They do not know how to stop themselves: they know no limits. Desire demands more, much more, than need. 'There is always a sense of limitlessness in desire' wrote the French religious thinker Simone Weil. To begin with, individuals seek power so as not to be dominated by others. But if they are not careful, they can soon find themselves overstepping the limit beyond which they are actually seeking to dominate others. Rivalry between human beings can only be surmounted when each individual puts a limit on his or her own desires. 'Limited desires,' notes Weil, 'are in harmony with the world; desires that contain the infinite are not.'

this approach remains firmly within premodern Aristotelian coordinates: the task is to retain the proper measure in desiring. Modernity is , however, defined by the coordinates of the Kantian philosophical revolution, in which *the absolute excess is that of the law itself*.  The law intervenes in the 'homogeneous' stability of our pleasure-oriented life as the shattering force of an absolute destabilising 'heterogeneity'. G.K. Chesterton made the same point in his famous 'Defence of Detective Stories', in which he remarks how the detective story: 

  keeps in some sense before the mind the fact that civilisation itself is the most sensational departures and the most romantic of rebellions... It is the agent of social justice who is the original and poetic figure, while the burglars and footpads are merely placid old cosmic conservatives, happy in the immemorial respectability of apes and wolves. (The police romance) is based on the fact that morality is the most dark and daring of conspiracies. 

There is the elementary matrix of the Hegelian dialectical process here: the external opposition (between law and its criminal transgression) is transformed into the opposition, internal to the transgression itself, between particular transgressions and the absolute transgression which appears as its opposite, as the universal law. And, *mutatis mutandis*, the same goes for violence: when we perceive something as an act of violence, we measure it by a presupposed standard of what the 'normal' non-violent situation is- and the highest form of violence is the imposition of this standard with reference to which some events appear as 'violent'. This is why language itself, the very medium of non-violence, of mutual recognition, involves unconditional violence. In other words, it is language itself which pushes our desire beyond proper limits, transforming it into a 'desire that contains the infinite', elevating it into an absolute striving that cannot ever be satisfied. What Lacan calls *objet petit a* is precisely this ethereal 'undead' object, the  surplus object that causes desire in its excessive and derailing aspect. One cannot get rid of this excess: it is consubstantial with human desire as such. 

So, to paraphrase Weil, in modernity, 'limited desires in harmony with the world' are the ultimate source of opportunist anti-ethical stance, they sustain the inertia of egotism and pleasure-seeking, while our contact with the good is sustained by 'desires that contain the infinite', that strives for the absolute. This gives rise to an irreducible ambiguity: the source of the good is a power that shatters the coordinates of our finite existence, a destructive power that, from the standpoint of our limited stable life-form, cannot but appear as evil. The same goes for the relationship between mortality and immortality. According to the traditional ideological commonplace, immortality is linked to the good and mortality to evil: what makes us good is the awareness of immortality (of God , of our soul, of the sublime ethical striving...), while the root of evil is the resignation to our mortality (we shall all die, so it doesn't really matter, just grab what you can, indulge your darkest whims... ). What, however, if one turns this commonplace round and wages the hypothesis that the primordial immortality is that of evil: evil is something which threatens to return for ever, a spectral dimension which magically survives its physical annihilation and continues to haunt us. This is why the victory of good over evil is the ability to die, to regain the innocence of nature, to find peace in getting rid of the obscene infinity of evil. Recall the classical scene from old horror movies: when a man who was possessed by some evil force - this possession being signalled by a freakish disfiguration of the body - is delivered from the undead spectre that colonised him, he regains the sere beauty of his everyday form and dies in peace. 

This is why Christ has to die -  pagan gods who cannot die are embodiments of obscene evil. Good versus evil is not spirit versus nature: the primordial evil is spirit itself with its violent derailment of nature. The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the properly human good,  the good elevated above the natural good, the infinite spiritual good, is ultimately *the mask of evil*.

So, perhaps, the fact that *reason* and *race* have the same root in Latin (*ratio*) tells us something: language, not primitive egotistic interest, is the first and greatest divider, it is because of language that we and our neighbours (can) ' live in different worlds' even when we live on the same street. What this means is that verbal violence is not a secondary distortion, but the ultimate resort of every specifically human violence. Take the example of anti-Semitic pogroms, which can stand in for all racist violence. What the perpetrators of pogroms find intolerable and rage-provoking, what they react to, is not the immediate reality of Jews, but to the image/figure of the 'Jew' which circulates and has been constructed in their tradition. The catch, of course, is that one single individual cannot distinguish in any simple way between real Jews and their anti-Semitic image: this image overdetermines the way I experience real Jews themselves and, furthermore, it affects the way Jews experience themselves. What makes a real Jew that an anti-Semite encounters on the street 'intolerable', what the anti-Semite tries to destroy when he attacks the Jew, the true target of his fury, is this fantasmatic dimension. 

The same principle applies to every political protest: when workers protest their exploitation, they do not protest a simple reality, but an experience of their real predicament made meaningful through language. Reality in itself, in its stupid existence, is never intolerable: it is language, its symbolisation, which makes it such. So precisely when we are dealing with the scene of a furious crowd, attacking and burning buildings and cars, lynching people, etc., we should never forget the placards they are carrying and the words which sustain and justify their acts. It was Heidegger who elaborated this feature at the formal-ontological level, when, in his reading of 'essence or *Wesen*' as a verb ('essencing'), he provided a deessentialised notion of essence. Traditionally, 'essence' refers to a stable core that guarantees the identity of a thing. For Heidegger, 'essence' is something that depends on the historical context, on the epochal disclosure of being that occurs in and through language. He calls this the 'house of being'. His expression '*Wesen der Sprache*' does not mean 'the essence of language', but the 'essencing', the making of essences that is the work of language

  ... language bringing things into their essence, language 'moving us' so that things matter to us in a particular kind of way, so that paths are made within which we can move among entities, and so that entities can bear on each other as the entities they are ... We share an originary language when the world is articulated in the same style for us, when we 'listen to language', when we 'let it say its saying to us'.

Let's unravel this a little. For a medieval Christian, the 'essence' of gold resides in its incorruptibility and divine sheen which make it a 'divine' metal. For us, it is either a flexivle resource to be used for industrial purposes or a material appropriate for aesthetic purposes. Another example: the castrato voice was once the very voice of angels prior to the Fall: for us today, it is a monstrous creation. This change in our sensitivity is sustained by language: it hinges on the shift in our symbolic universe. A fundamental violence exists in this 'essencing' ability of language: our world is given a partial twist, it loses its balanced innocence, one partial colour gives the tone of the hwhole. The operation designated by the political thinker Ernesto Laclau as that of hegemony is inherent to language. So when, in his reading of the famous chorus from *Antigone* on the 'uncanny/demonic' character of man in the *Introduction to Metaphysics*, Heidegger deploys the notion of 'ontological' violence that pertains to every founding gesture of the new communal world of a people, accomplished by poets, thinkers and statesmen, one should always bear in mind that this 'uncanny/demonic' dimension is ultimately that of language itself: 

  Violence is usually seen in terms of the domain in which concurring compromise and mutual assistance set the standard for *Dasein*, and accordingly all violence is necessarily deemed only a disturbance and an offence ... The violent one, the creative one who sets forth into the unsaid, who breaks into the unthought, who compels what has never happened and makes appear what is unseen - this violent one stands at all times inn daring ... Therefore the violence-doer knows no kindness and conciliation (in the ordinary sense), no appeasement and mollification by success or prestige and by their confirmation ... For such a one, disaster is the deepest and broadest Yes to the Overwhelming ... Essential decision, when it is carried out and when it resists the constantly pressing ensnarement in the everyday and the customary, has to use violence. This act of violence, this de-cided setting out upon the way to the Being of beings, move humanity out of the hominess of what is most directly nearby and what is usual. 

As such, the Creator is '*hupsipolis apolis*' (*antigone*, line 270): he stands outside and above *polis* and its *ethos*; only as such can he ground a new form of *ethos*, of communal being in a *polis*... Of course, what reverberates here is the topic of an 'illegal violence that founds the rule of the law itself. Heidegger hastens to add how the first victim of this violence is the Creator himself, who has to be erased with the advent of the new order that he grounded. This erasure can take different forms. The first is physical destruction - from Moses and Julius Caesar onwards, we know that a founding figure has to be killed. But there is also the relapse into madness. as in the case of great poets, from Holderlin to Ezra Pound, who were blinded by the very force of their poetic vision. Interestingly, the point in *Antigone* where the chorus bewails man as the most 'demonic' of all creatures, as a being of excess, a being who violates all proper measures, comes immediately after it is revealed that someone has defied Creon's order and performed the funeral ritual on his body. It is *this* act which is perceived as a 'demonic' excessive act, not Creon's prohibition. Antigone is far from being the place-holder of moderation, of respect for proper limits, against Creon's sacrilegious hubris; quite the contrary, the true violence is hers. 

What accounts for the chilling character of the quoted passage is that Heidegger does not merely provide a new variation on his standard rhetorical figure of inversion ('the essence of violence has nothingg to do with ontic violence, suffering, war, destruction, etc.; the essence of violence resides in the character of the very imposition/founding of the new mode of the Essence - disclosure of communal Being - itself'); implicitly, but clearly, Heidegger reads this essential violence as something that grounds - or, at least, opens up the space for - the explosions of ontic of physical violence itself. Consequently, we should not immunise ourselves against the effects of the violence Heidegger is talking about by classifying it as 'merely' ontological: although it is violent as such, imposing a certain disclosure of world, this world constellation also involves social relations of authority. In his interpretation of Heraclitus fragment 53 ('Conflict (*polemos*) is the father of all things and king of all. Some he shows to be gods and others men; some he makes slaves and others free'), Heidegger - in contrast to those who accuse him of omitting to consider the 'cruel' aspects of the ancient Greek life (slavery,etc.) - openly draws attention to how 'rank and dominance' are directly grounded in a disclosure of being, thereby providing a direct ontological grounding to social relations of domination:

  If people today from time to time are going to busy themselves rather too eagerly with the polis of the Greeks, they should not suppress this side of it: otherwise the concept of the polis easily becomes innocuous and sentimental. What is higher in rank is what is stronger. Thus Being, logos, as the gathered harmony, is not easily available for every man at the same price, but is concealed, as opposed to that harmony which is always mere equalizing, the elimination of tension, leveling. 

There is thus a direct link between the ontological violence and the texture of social violence (of sustaining relations of enforced domination) that pertains to language. In her *America Day by Day* (1948), Simone de Beauvoir noted: 'many racists, ignoring the rigors of science, insist on declaring that even if the psychological reasons haven't been established, the fact is that blacks *are* inferior. You only have to travel through America to be convinced of it.' Her point about racism has been too easily misunderstood. In a recent commentary, for example, Stella Sandford claims that 'nothing justifies Beauvoir's ... acceptance of the 'fact' of this inferiority': 

  With her existentialist philosophical framework, we might rather have expected Beauvoir to talk about the *interpretation of* existing physiological differences in terms of inferiority and superiority ... or to point out the mistake involved in the use of the value judgements 'inferior' and 'superior' to name alleged properties of human beings, as if to 'confirm a given fact'. 

It is clear what bothers Sandford here. She is aware that Beauvoir's claim about the factual inferiority of blacks aims at something more than the simple social fact that, in the American South of (not only) that time, blacks were treated as inferior by the white majority and, in a way, they effectively *were* inferior. But her critical solution, propelled by the care to avoid racist claims on the factual inferiority of blacks, is to relativise their inferiority into a matter of interpretation and judgement by white racists, and distance it from a question of their very being. But what this softening distinction misses is the truly trenchant dimension of racism: the 'being' of blacks (as of whites or anyone else) is a socio-symbolic being. When they are treated by whites as inferior, this does indeed make them inferior at the level of their socio-symbolic identity. In other words, the white racist ideology exerts a performative efficiency. It is not merely an interpretation of what blacks are, but an interpretation that determines the very being and social existence of the interpreted subjects. 

We can now locate precisely what makes Sandoford and other critics of Beauvoir resist her formulation that blacks *were* inferior: this resistance is itself ideological. At the base of this ideology is the fear that, if one concedes this point, we will have lost the inner freedom, autonomy and dignity of the human individual. Which is why such critics insist that blacks are not inferior but merely 'inferiorised' by the violence imposed on them by white racist discourse. That is, they are affected by an imposition which does not affect them in the very core of their being, and, consequently, which they can (and do) resist as free autonomous agents through their acts, dreams and projects. 

This brings us back to the starting point of this chapter, the abyss of the Neighbour. Though it may appear that there is a contradiction between the way discourse constitutes the very core of the subject's identity and the notion of this core as an unfathomable abyss beyond the 'wall of language', there is a simple solution to this apparent paradox. The 'wall of language' which forever separates me from the abyss of another subject is simultaneously that which opens up and sustains this abyss - the very obstacle that separates me from the Beyond is what creates its mirage.
