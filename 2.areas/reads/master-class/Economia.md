### Dismal Science
population would always grow faster than food , dooming mankind to unending poverty and hardship . 

_Paul Kroogman_

	population would always grow faster than food , dooming mankind to unending poverty and hardship . 

 this has been true for 58 of the last 60 centuries

	Economy is about what you cant do / there is always tradeoffs and it is generally not pretty

	Has always been (riches) in a small number of a few people / podria ser que estemos en epoca tipo "belle epoch" de la economia , 
		Belle epoch :
			- crece clase media
	With all cool things of economy doesnt look like is going to do anything productive to relieve that tension (unequal distribution) . 

Most Economic Thinking comes down to two principles

- $100 dont lie on the street very long
	- people take advvantage of oportunities

- every sale is also a purchase , things add up . 
	- not one individual , economy buying as much as it sells . 

### Principle 1 
People take advantage of Incentives

### Principle 2
Every Sale is a Purchase

Aplplyes to a lot of stuff 
- balance of payments between two parties (sells/purchases)
- parable of baby sitting crisis
	- Journal of Money , Credit Banking
	- coupons for babysitting : they stopped asking ffor babysitting (recession) : you just had to print more coupons . 
	- Your sale is my purchase

Good Economics : 
 - Ricardian model of land rent
 - irving fisher's theory of debt deflation
