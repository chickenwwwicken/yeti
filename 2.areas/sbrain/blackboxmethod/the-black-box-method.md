 in this diagram vertical distance represents time and basically the standard strategy for learning is to pick some list of topics and then learn them one by one. However this is rather slow and during the period of learning for the topics that you haven't even looked at yet you won't know anything or much about any of them.

now let's introduce black boxing which is much closer to the unknown side of things because it doesn't take that much time to learn it. It's an easy gap to cross versus learning an entire thing now say I black box all three of the concepts before starting to fully learn them not necessarily as a substitute for learning them just as a start and I think this should be the way that black boxing is used. It's still a good idea to eventually learn things because it's sort of going to be necessary if you ever want to make modifications to something which does show up somewhat frequently.
