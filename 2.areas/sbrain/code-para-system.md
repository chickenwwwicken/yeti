## Capture
onlly what resonates
"Whatever doesn't hellp you make progress on project, is probably distracting from them"
If on the go, throw the text/idea in the inbox, don't worry about perfection
## Organize
When you come back during your daily org routine:
- add linnks
- make sure the note belongs to an area
- hopefully also linked to a project
## Distill
the information, use "progressive summary":
- Note captured - raw data
- bolded passsages - bold the relevant parts
- highlighted passages - highlight specific areas
- mark key words
- executive summary - use your own words to summarize
## Express
express notes with your own words!
- We only know what we make
