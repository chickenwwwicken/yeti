## 0.1.1 Minimal Bash like line editing is supported - Grub error

![[$$$/$cheats/$oss/$linux/0_resources/media/Pasted image 20240904135359.png]]

some commands that work:
- exit will get you back to BIOS or reboot 

#### 1. Boot into the live linux USB 
- turn off computer
- reboot and `F11` (in MSI motherboard)
- chose bootable UEFI USB

#### 2. EFI or BIOS
- MSI1 is EFI
- most systems now are EFI
- but to find out: 

Open terminal and run:
this command lists your disk partitions

``` bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

or 

``` bash
lsblk
```

what is normal: 

```
Device        Start       End   Sectors   Size Type
/dev/sda1      2048    976895    974848   476M EFI System
/dev/sda2    976896  40038399  39061504  18.6G Linux filesystem
/dev/sda3  40038400  79099903  39061504  18.6G Linux Swap
```

	(MSI1 has two main disks: `nvme0n1` and `nvme1n1` 
	each had one EFI System : one for Mint and one for Kali
	for erasing your whole memories from a bootable USB go to issue 0.1.2 )


You need to note two things here:
- the partition where EFI is installed
- the partition where root partition is installed (normally where "Linux Filesystem")

#### 3. Reinstall grub

Mount root partition first

``` bash
sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
```

Mount EFI partition:

```
sudo mount  /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi
```

Reinstall grub

``` bash
sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot --bootloader-id=ubuntu  --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/mnt/boot/efi  
```

restart

``` bash
shutdown -r now
```


## 0.1.2 Deleting all data in disks from a bootable USB

1. Open Terminal

2. List All Disk Partitions

``` bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

3. Enter one of your disks
	- `nvme0n1` = put the name of your disk here.
This command will get u in a special menu with a `#` 

``` bash
sudo fdisk /dev/nvme0n1
```

4. Delete a partition
- press `d` to delete a partition and then press the number of the partition u wanna delete
- (probably delete all of them)

5. Write changes to disk and exit
- `w` write the changes to the disk
- `q` to quit the `fdisk`
