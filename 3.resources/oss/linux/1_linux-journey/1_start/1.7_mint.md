#### Overview
Linux Mint is based off of Ubuntu. It uses Ubuntu’s software repositories so the same packages are available on both distributions. If you prefer a lighter distro than Ubuntu, you may be interested in Linux Mint.

#### Package Management
Since Linux Mint is Ubuntu based, it uses the Debian package manager.

#### Configurability
Great user interface, great for beginners and less bloated than Ubuntu. In this course, I’ll be using Linux Mint, but any other distribution can be used.

#### Uses
Great for desktop and laptop.
