Make copies of files

``` bash
cp file.txt /home/user/Documents/newdirectory
```

copies `file.txt` to `newdirectory`

Copy multiple files and dirs as well as use wildcards
Wildcard is a char that can be substituted for a pattern based selection. 
You can use wildcards in every command for more flexibility.
- `*` wildcard of wildcards, used to represent all single chars or any string
- `?` used to represent one character
- `[]` used to represent any character within the brackets.

``` bash
cp *.jpg /home/pete/Pictures
```

This copies all .jpg files in your current repo to `Pictures` repo

`-r` flag will recursively copy the files and directories within a directory.

``` bash
cp -r Pumpkin/ /home/pete/Pictures
```

This command copies all files and dirs from `Pumpkin` to `Pictures` directory. 

NOTE: If you copy a file over to a dir that has the same filename, the file will be overwritten with 2whatever you are copying over. 
This is no bueno if you have a file that you don't want to get accidentally overwritten. 
You can use the `-i` flag (interactive) to prompt you before overwriting a file. 

``` bash
cp -i mycoolfile /home/pete/Pictures
```
