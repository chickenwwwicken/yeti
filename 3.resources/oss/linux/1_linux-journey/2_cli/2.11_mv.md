Moving and Renaming files. 
Similar to the cp command in terms of flags and functionality

Renaming files

``` bash
mv oldfile newfile
```

Move to a different dir

``` bash
mv file1 /home/pete/Documents
```

Move more than one file to a different dir

``` bash
mv file1 file2 /home/pete/Documents
```

Rename directories

``` bash
mv dir1 dir2
```

to avoid overwriting "dir2"

``` bash 
mv -i dir1 dir2
```

overwriting a file/directory but also making a backup of the overwritten file/dir
(will rename the old version with a `~`)

``` bash
mv -b dir1 dir2

mv -b oldfile newfile
```
