Remove files/directories

``` bash
rm file1
```

Take caution when using rm. once `rm` they are RM

There are safety measures for protecting files also. 
Write-protected files will prompt you for confirmation before deleting them.
If Dir is write-protected, also not easily removed.

use `-f` (force) flag to remove all of those protected files also

``` bash
rm -f file1 file2
```

use `-i` and it will give prompt on whether you want to remove or not

``` bash
rm -i file1 file2
```

use `-r` to delete files and subdirs recursively from a directory

``` bash
rm -r directory1
```

`rmdir` to remove a directory

``` bash
rmdir directory
```
