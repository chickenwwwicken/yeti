if you need to type a long command many times, 
it's best to have an alias you can use for that command. 
To create an alias for a command simply specify an alias name and set it to the command. 

``` bash
alias foobar='ls -la'
```

Now instead of typing `ls -la` you can type `foobar` and it will execute that command. 
Won't save your alias after reboot, 
if you want to keep it permanent add this line inside your bash config file `.bashrc` 

you can remove an alias like this

``` bash
unalias foobar
```
