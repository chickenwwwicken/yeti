Join multiple files together by a common field.

``` 
file1.txt
1 John
2 Jane
3 Mary

file2.txt
1 Doe
2 Doe
3 Sue
```

``` bash
join file1.txt file2.txt
1 John Doe
2 Jane Doe
3 Mary Sue
```

They are joined together by the first field by default and the fields have to be identical.
If not identical you can sort them. In this case they are joined via 1 2 3 

---
To join this files you need to specify which fields you are joining, 
in this case we want field 2 on file1.txt and field 1 on file2.txt

``` 
file1.txt
John 1
Jane 2
Mary 3

file2.txt
1 Doe
2 Doe
3 Sue
```

so command would look like this

``` bash
join -1 2 -2 1 file1.txt file2.txt
1 John Doe
2 Jane Doe
3 Mary Sue
```

`-1 2` refers to file1.txt : field 2
`-2 1` refers to file2.txt : field 1

---
Split a file 

``` bash
split somefile
```

this will split it into different files, 
by default it will split them once they reach a 1000 line limit. 
The files will be named x** by default.
