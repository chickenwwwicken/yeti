Sorting lines

``` bash
file1.txt
dog
cow
cat
elephant
bird

sort file1.txt
bird 
cat
cow 
dog
elephant
```

reverse sort :

``` bash
sort -r file1.txt
elephant
dog
cow
cat
bird
```

Numerical value:

``` bash
sort -n file1.txt
bird
cat
cow 
elephant
dog
```

The real power of sort comes with ability to be combined with other commands, 
Try this command

``` bash
ls /etc | sort -rn
```

sorts /etc by numerical and reverse CRAZYYYY shit.
