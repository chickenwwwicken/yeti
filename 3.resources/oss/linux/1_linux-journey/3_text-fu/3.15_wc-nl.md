`wc` word count command shows the total count of words in a file.

``` bash
wc /etc/passwd
96    265    5925
```

- number of lines = 96
- number of words = 265
- number of bytes = 5925

for each of these theres a flag
- `l` = lines
- `w` = words
- `c` = bytes

---
check the count of lines on a file :

``` bash
file.txt
i
like
turtles

nl file.txt
1. i
2. like
3. turtles
```

get the final count of lines in output using `nl`:

``` bash
nl file.txt | tail
```
