Standard Out

I/O (input/output) streams

``` bash
echo Hello World > peanuts.txt
```

this command prints 'Hello World' inside a new file called 'peanuts.txt' 

by default `echo` command takes the input (stdin) from the keyboard 
and returns the output (stdout) to the screen, in this case `>` transfers stdout to `peanuts.txt` 

this `>` helps to redirect I/O 

`>` is a redirection operator allows us to change where the stdout goes.
if file given don't exist it creates it.
if file given exists it will overwrite it ! 

If file exists and don't wanna overwrite, 
Use `>>` this operator will append `Hello World` to the end of the `peanuts.txt` file.

``` bash
echo Hello World >> peanuts.txt
```
