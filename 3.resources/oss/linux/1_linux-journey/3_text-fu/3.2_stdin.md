Standard In

We have different standard inputs:
- keyboard
- other files
- output from other processes 
- terminal

``` bash
cat < peanuts.txt > banana.txt
```

Normally in cat command you send a file to it and that becomes the stdin
In this case we redirected `peanuts.txt` to be our stdin.
Then output of `cat` (`peanuts.txt`) gets redirected to another file called `banana.txt`

Try these out 

``` bash
echo < peanuts.txt > banana.txt

# overwrites banana.txt with whatever ls wouldve printed 
ls < peanuts.txt > banana.txt

# overwrites banana.txt with your currend working directory
pwd < peanuts.txt > banana.txt
```
