list the contents of a directory that don't exist on system and redirect output to the peanuts.txt file

``` bash
ls /fake/directory > peanuts.txt

# ls: cannot access '/fake/directory': No such file or directory  
```

Another I/O stream in play is stderr (standard error).

By default, stderr sends its ouput to the screen but, 
it's a completely different stream than stdout. 
Redirecting stderr is completely different too.

U use file descriptor
File descriptor = non-negative number that is used to access a file or stream.

file descriptors:
- `0` = stdin
- `1` = stdout
- `2` = stderr

Redirecting stderr:

``` bash
ls /fake/directory 2> peanuts.txt
```

Redirect both stdout and stderr to a file: 

``` bash
ls /fake/directory &> peanuts.txt
```
