the output of this is very long

``` bash
ls -la /etc
```

we can redirect this output to another command like `less`

``` bash
ls -la /etc | less
```

`|` pipe operator gets stdout of command and makes it the stdin to another process. 
In this case we took the stdout of `ls -la /etc` and piped it to the `less` command

Write the output of my command to two different streams:

``` bash
# tee command
ls | tee peanuts.txt
```
