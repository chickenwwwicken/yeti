Paste command is similar to the cat command,
merges lines together in a file. 

suppose this as your file 

``` sample2.txt
The
quick
brown
fox
```

Combine all these into one line

``` bash
paste -s  sample2.txt
```

![[$$$/$cheats/$oss/$linux/0_resources/media/Pasted image 20240905145230.png]]

default delimiter for paste is TAB, so now there's one line with TABs separating each.

---
Change the delimiter `-d` to something more readable:

``` bash
paste -d ' ' -s sample2.txt
```

---
multiple files

``` bash
paste -s sample.txt sample2.txt
```
