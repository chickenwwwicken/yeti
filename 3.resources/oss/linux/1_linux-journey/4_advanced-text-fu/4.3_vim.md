Vim stands for vi (improved) just like its name stands for an improved version of the vi text editor and command. 

It's super lightweight , opening and editing a file with vim is quick and easy. 
It's almost always available, if you booted up a random linux distro,
chances are vim is installed by default.

fire up vim:

``` bash
vim
```
