Emacs is extremely powerful.
It's extensible : you can write up scripts for emacs that extend its functionality.

To start emacs : 

``` bash
emacs
```

Will be greeted with default welcome buffer.
Buffers in emacs is what your text resides in.
If you open file, buffer is used to store that file's content.

You can have multiple buffers open at the same time 
can easily switch between buffers
