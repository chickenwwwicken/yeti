Usersnames aren't really identifications for users. 
The system uses a user ID (UID) to identify a user.
To find out what users are mapped to what ID, look at the `/etc/passwd` file

`cat /etc/passwd`

This file shows a list of users and detailed info about them. 
The first is most likely `root` and looks like this `root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash` 

Each line displays user info for one user.
There are many fields separated by colons that tell you info about user

1. Username
2. User's password - the passwords are stored in the `/etc/passwd`
	1. `x` = password is stored in `etc/passwd` 
	2. `*` = user doesn't have login access 
	3. ` ` = user doesn't have login access
3. UID - User ID 
4. GID - Group ID
5. GECOS field - This is used to leave comments about the user or account (comma delimited)
6. User's home directory
7. User's shell - a lot of user's default to bash

Normally you would expect to see just human users. 
you'll notice `/etc/passwd` contains other users. 
Remember that users are really only on the syystem to run processes with different permissions. 
Sometimes we want to run processes with pre-determined permissions. 
Daemon user is used for daemon processes. 

Note that you can edit the `/etc/passwd` file by hand if you wanna add users and modify info with the `vipw` tool. however it's best leave it to other tools such as `useradd` `userdel`
