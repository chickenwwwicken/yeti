Most enterprise environments are using management systems to manage users, accts, passwds.
However on a single machine computer there are useful commands to run to manage users.

#### Adding Users

`useradd` - contains also more features like : making a homedir and more

```
sudo useradd bob
```

above command creates an entry in `/etc/passwd` for bob
sets up default groups and adds an entry to the `/etc/shadow` file.

#### Removing Users

To remove a user, you can use the userdel command:

``` bash
sudo userdel bob
```

Does its best to undo the file changes by useradd.

#### Changing Passwords

``` bash
passwd bob
```

This will allow you to change the password of yourself or another user (if you are root).
