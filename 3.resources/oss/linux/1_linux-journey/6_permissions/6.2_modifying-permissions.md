Changing perms can easily be done with `chmod` 

1. Pick which perm set you wanna change
2. Add or remove perms with `+` or `-` 

#### Adding perms on a bit file

``` bash
chmod u+x myfile
```

changes permission on myfile by adding executable permission bit on the user set.
Now the user has executable permission on this file.

#### Removing a permission bit on a file

``` bash
chmod u-x myfile
```

#### Adding multiple permission bits on a file

``` bash
chmod ug+w
```

There is another way to change permissions using a numerical font. 
This method allows you to change permissions all at once. 
Instead of using `r,w,x` to represent permissions, you'll use a numerical representation.

So no need to specify the group with g or user with g
