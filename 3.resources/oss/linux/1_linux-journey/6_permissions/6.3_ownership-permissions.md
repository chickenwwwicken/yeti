In addition to modifying perms on files, 
you can also modify the group and user ownership of file as well.

#### Modify user ownership

``` bash
sudo chown patty myfile
```

This command will set the owner of myfile to patty

#### Modify group ownership

``` bash
sudo chgrp whales myfile
```

This command will set the group of myfile to whales

#### Modify both user and group ownership at the same time

``` bash
sudo chown patty:whales myfile
```
