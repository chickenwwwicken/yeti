Every file that gets created comes with a default set of perms.
If you ever wanted to change that default set of perms, 
you can do so with the umask command. 
This command takes the 3 bit permission set we see in numerical permissions. 

Instead of adding these permissions though, 
`umask` takes away these permissions:

``` bash
umask 021
```

In this command, we are stating that we want default permissions of new files to allow users access to everything, but for groups we wanna take away their write permission and forr others we wanna take awayy their executable permission. 

The default umask on most distros is 022,
meaning all user access, but no write access for group and other users. 

When u run the umask command it will give that default set of permissions on any new file.
However if you want it to persist you'll have to modify `.profile`
