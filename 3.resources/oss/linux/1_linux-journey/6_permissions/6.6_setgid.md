Similar to the set user ID permission bit, there is a set group ID (SGID) permission bit.
This bit allows a program to run as if it was a member of that group

``` bash
ls -l /usr/bin/wall
-rwxr-sr-x 1 root tty 19024 Dec 14 11:45 /usr/bin/wall
```

We can see that the permission bit is in the group permission set.

#### Modifying SGID

``` bash
sudo chmod g+s myfile
sudo chmod 2555 myfile
```

Num representation for SGID is `2`
