This permission bit, 'sticks a file/directory' 
this means that only the owner or the root user can delete or modify the file.
This is very useful for shared directories. 

``` bash
ls -ld /tmp
drwxrwxrwxt 6 root root 4096 Dec 15 11:45 /tmp
```

the special permission is `t`, this means everyone can add files, write files, modify files in the /tmp directory but only root can delete the `/tmp` directory/

#### Modify the sticky bit

``` bash 
sudo chmod +t mydir

sudo chmod 1755 mydir
```

the num representation of the sticky bit is `1`
