Everything in Linux is a file, even processes.
Process information is stored in a special filesystem known as the `/proc` filesys.

``` bash
ls /proc
```

You should see multiple values, 
there are sub-directories for every PID.

If you looked at a PID in the ps output, you would be able to find it in the /proc directory

Checkout one of the processes in `/proc` 

``` bash
cat /proc/[PID]/status
```

You should see process state information as well as more detailed information
The `/proc` dir is how the kernel views the system.
