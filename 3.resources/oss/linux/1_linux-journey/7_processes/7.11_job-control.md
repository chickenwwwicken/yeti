Control how our processes run with jobs:

#### Sending a job to the background

Ampersand `&` to the command will run it in the background so you can still use your shell.

``` bash
sleep 1000 &
sleep 1001 &
sleep 1002 &
```

#### View all background jobs

``` bash
jobs

[1]    Running    sleep 1000 &
[2]-   Running    sleep 1001 &
[3]+   Running    sleep 1002 &
```

1. Job Id 
2. Status
3. Command that was run
- + = most recent background job that started.
- - = second most recent command

#### Sending a job to the background on existing job

If you already ran a job , and wanna send it to the background, 
You ain't gotta terminate it and start over again.
First suspend the job with Ctrl-Z, then run the `bg` command to send it to background.

``` bash
sleep 1003
# loading and taking time, to suspend
Ctrl-Z
# send sleep 1003 to background
bg
```

#### Moving a job from the background to the foreground

To move a job out of the background just specify the job ID you want.
If you run `fg` without any options, it will bring back the most recent background job.

``` bash
fg %[jobID]
```

#### Kill background jobs

Similar to moving jobs out of the bbackground, 
you can use the same form to kill the processes by using their Job Id

``` bash 
kill %[jobID]
```
