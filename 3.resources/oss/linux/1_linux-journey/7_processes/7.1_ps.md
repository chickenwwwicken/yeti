(Processes) are the programs that are running on your machine. 
They are managed by the kernel and each process has an ID associated with it called PID.
This PID is assigned in the order that processes are created. 

Go ahead and run the `ps` command to see a list of running processes.

``` bash
ps 
```

- `PID` : Process ID
- `TTY` : Controlling terminal associated with the process
- `STAT` : Process status code
- `TIME` : Total CPU usage time
- `CMD` : Name of executable command

if u do `ps man` you'll see lots of command options you can pass

`a` - displays all processes running
`u` - shows moore details about the processes
`x` - lists all processes that don't have TTY associated with it

Note: no TTY processes have a `?` in that field

`USER` - effective user (those who are using it)
`PID` - process ID
`%CPU` - CPU time used divided by the time process has been running
`%MEM` - Ratio of the process's resident set size to the physical memory on the machine
`VSZ` - Virtual memory usage of the entire process
`RSS` - Resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used
`TTY` - Controlling terminal associated with the process
`STAT` - Process status code
`START` - Start time of the process
`TIME` - Total CPU usage time
`COMMAND` - Name of executable/command

The `ps` command can get a lil messy to look at

Useful command is the `top` gives you real time information about the processes running on your system instead of a snapshot.
