TTY = terminal that executed the command

Two types of terminals:
- Terminal devices - native terminal device u can type into and send output to your system
- Pseudoterminal devices - what u generally use

`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `F1` to get into TTY1 (first virtual console) 
This is considered a regular terminal device (`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `F7`) to exit.

Pseudoterminals emulate terminals with the shell terminal window and are denoted by PTS.
If you look at ps again, you'll see your shell process under `pts/*`


There are processes such as daemon processes that are essentially keeping the system running. 
They often start at system boot and usually terminate when the system is shutdown.
They run in the background and since we don't want these special processes to get terminated
they are not bound to a controlling terminal. 
In the ps output, the TTY is listed as a `?` meaning it does not have a controlling terminal.
