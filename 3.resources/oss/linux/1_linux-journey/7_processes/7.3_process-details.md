A process is a running program on the system,
more precisely it's the system allocating memory, CPU , I/O to make the program run.
A process is an instance of a running program, 

Running three terminal windows: 
1. run `cat` without passing any options
2. run `cat` without passing any options
3. run `ps aux | grep cat`

You'll see that there are two processes for cat, even though they are calling the same program.

The Kernel is in charge of processes, when we run a program the kernel loads up the code of the program in memory, determines and allocates resources and then keeps tabs on each process, it knows:

- status of the process
- resources the process is using and receives
- process owner
- signal handling 
- everything else.

All processes are trying to get a taste of that sweet resource pir, 
it's the kernel's job to make sure that processes get the right amount of resources depending on process demands. 
When a process ends, the resources it used are now freed up for other processes.
