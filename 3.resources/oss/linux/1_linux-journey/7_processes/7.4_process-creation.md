When a new process is created, an existing process basically clones itself using something called the fork system call (system calls will be discussed very far into the future). 
The fork system call creates a mostly identical child process, this child process takes on a new process ID (PID) and the original process becomes its parent proces and ahs something called a parent process ID PPID. 
Afterwards the child process can either continue to use the same program its parent was using before or more often use the `execve` system call to launch up a new program. 
This system call destroys the memory management that the kernel put into place for that process and sets up new ones for the new program.

We can see this in action:

``` bash
ps l
```

The `l` option gives us a "long format" or even more detailed view of our running processes.

Look at terminal, you'll see a process running that's your shell, 
since you ran `ps l` from the shell, 
you'll see that the PID of the bash shell is the PPID of the `ps l` command.

There must be a mother of all processes.
When the system boots up, the kernels creates a process called `init` , it has a PID of `1`

`init` = PID `1`

The init process can't be terminated unless the system shuts down. 
It runs with root privileges and runs many processes that keep the system goin.
