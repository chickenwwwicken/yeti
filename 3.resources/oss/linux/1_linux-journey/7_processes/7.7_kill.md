You can send signals that terminate processes, such a command is aptly named the kill command:

``` bash
kill [PID]
```

By default it sends a TERM signal, 
The SIGTERM signal is sent to a process to request its termination by allowing it to cleanly release its resources and saving its state. 

You can also specify a signal with the kill command:

``` bash
kill -9 [PID]
```

This will run the SIGKILL signal and kill the process.

#### Differences between SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGSTOP

- SIGHUP - Hangup, sent to a process when the controlling terminal is closed. For example, if you closed a terminal window that had a process running in it, you would get a SIGHUP signal. So basically you've been hung up on.
- SIGINT - Is an interrupt signal, so you can use Ctrl-C and the system will try to kill the process
- SIGTERM - Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup first.
- SIGKILL - Kill the process, kill it with fire, doesn't do any cleanup
- SIGSTOP - Stop/suspend a process
