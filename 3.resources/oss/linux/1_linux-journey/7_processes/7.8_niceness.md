There is a way to influence the kernel's process scheduling algorithm with a `nice` variable.
It means that processes have a number to determine their priority for the CPU and a low or negative number means the process is not very nice and it wants to get as much of the CPU as possible.

1. Checkout the `NI` column

``` bash
top
```

2. set priority for a new process:

``` bash
nice -n 5 apt upgrade
```

3. set priority on an existing process:

``` bash
renice 10 -p [PID]
```
