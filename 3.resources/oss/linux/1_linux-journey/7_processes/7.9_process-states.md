`STAT` column you'll see lots of values. 
A linux process can be in a number of different states. 
The most common state codes you'll see are described below:

- `R` - running or runnable, waiting for the CPU to process it
- `S` - Interruptible sleep, waiting for an event to complete, such as input from the terminal
- `D` - Uninterruptible Sleep, processes that can't be killed w a signal, reboot or fix the issue
- `Z` - Zombie, terminated processes that are waiting to have their status collected
- `T` - Stopped, a process that has been suspended/stopped
