How do packages that get uploaded to the internet somehow end up on our computers?
Do u go to the download page of each package you want and click download and install?
Well, actually you can do that, but there is something better called package repos. 

Repos are just a central storage location for packages.
There are tons of repos that hold lots of packages and they all found on the internet, 
no silly installation disks.
Your machine doesn't know where to look for these repos unless you explicitly tell it where to look.

Instead of going to their website to download the package directly, 
you can tell your machine to find the repo software from the source link.

Your distro already comes with pre-approved sources to get packages from and 
this is how it installs all the base packages you see on your system. 
On a Debian system, this sources file is the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file.
Your machine will know how to look there and check for any source repos you added.
