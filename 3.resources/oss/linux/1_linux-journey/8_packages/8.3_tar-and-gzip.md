We need to discuss archiving and compressing files, 
because you will most likely encounter these when you hunt for software on the internet.

You probably already know what a file archive is, 
you've most likely encountered file types such as `.tar` and `.zip` .
These are an archive of files, they contain many files inside of them, 
but they come in this very neat single file known as an archive.

#### Compressing files with `gzip`

`gzip` is a program used to compress files in Linux, they end in a `.gz` extension.

##### Compressing a file

``` bash
gzip mycoolfile
```

##### Decompressing a file

``` bash
gunzip mycoolfile.gz
```

#### Creating archives with tar
Unfortunately, `gzip` can't add multiple files into one archive for us.
Luckily we have the tar program which does.
When you create an archive using tar, it will have a `.tar` extension.

``` bash
tar cvf mytarfile.tar mycoolfile1 mycoolfile2
```

`c` - create
`v` - tell program to be verbose and let us see what it's doing.
`f` - the filename of the tar file has cto come after this option, if you are creating a tar file you'll have to come up with a file name

#### Unpacking archives with `tar`

To extract the contents of a tar file:

``` bash
tar svf mytarfile.tar
```

`x` - extract
`v` - tell the program to be verbose and let us see what it's doing
`f` - the file you want to extract

#### Compressing/Uncompressing archives with `tar` and `gzip`

Many times you'll see a tar file that has been compressed such as mycompressedarchive.tar.gz,
all you need to do is work outside in, so first remove the compression with `gunzip` 
and then you can unpack the tar file. 

Or you can alternatively use the `z` option with tar, which just tells it to use the `gzip` utility.

##### Create a compressed tar file:

``` bash
tar czf myfile.tar.gz
```

##### Uncompress and unpack

```
tar xzf file.tar
```
