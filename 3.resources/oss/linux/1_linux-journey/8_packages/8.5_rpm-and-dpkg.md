Just like `.exe` is a single executable file, so is `.deb` and `.rpm`.
You normally wouldn't see these if you use package repos, 
but if you directly download packages,
you will most likely get them in these popular format. 
Obviously, they are exclusive to their distros.

To install these direct packages, you can use the package management commands:
`rpm` and `dpkg`.
These tools are used to install package files, 
however they will not install the package dependencies, 
so if your package had 10 dependencies, 
you would have to install those packages separately and then their dependencies.

Keep in mind that there will be countless times when you need to install, 
query or verify a package with one of these tools, 
so remember these commands.

#### Install a package

``` bash
# debian
dpkg -i some_deb_package.deb
# rpm
rpm -i some_rpm_package.rpm
```

`i` stands for install

#### Remove a package

``` bash
# debian
dpkg -r some_deb_package.deb
# rpm
rpm -e some_rpm_package.rpm
```

`r` - for remove
`e` - erase

#### List installed packages

``` bash
# deb
dpkg -l
# rpm
rpm -qa
```
