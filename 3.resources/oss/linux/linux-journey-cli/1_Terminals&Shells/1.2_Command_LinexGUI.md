#### What is CLI
A program that allows you to interact with your computer in a text-based way

#### What is GUI
When you use a mouse to click on fancy icons, button, and menus, u using GUI

GUI's have some drawbacks:
- They weak. You are given much more control over your computer through a CLI. With a GUI you're limited to the options that the dev of the GUI has given you.
- They slow. Once you know the commands to type, it's much faster to type them than to click through endless menus with a mouse.
- They're not as reproducible. If you want to share a set of instructions, you can just copy and paste commands without worrying about screen sizes and user preferences.
- They're not automatable. It's easy to write code that manipulates text (as you've seen in Python), but it's much harder to write code that manipulates GUI's
- They not as cool. You will be invited to 90% fewer romantic outings if you are a GUI user.
