Terms 'shell' , 'CLI' and 'terminal' are often used to refer to the same thing: a program that lets you issue text-based commands.

However, to get pedantic, the 'terminal' is just one specific part of that program. 
Historically, the word 'terminal' meant a physical device that you could type commands into, essentially a keyboard and a screen.

These days, we really mean 'terminal emulator'. 
A terminal emulator is a program that emulates a physical terminal.
It's a program that lets you type commands into a window on your computer.

Which commands you're able to use isn't determined by the terminal emulator that you happen to be using. 
It's determined by the 'shell'
