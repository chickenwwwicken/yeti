So if your terminal is just a program that lets you issue text-based commands and renders the output of those commands...

What is the program that runs those commands?

That's a shell

Shells do a lot of things, but their main job is to interpret the commands you type and execute them.

#### REPL
Shells are often referred to as REPLs this stands for:
- Read
- Eval
- Print
- Loop

This is a fancy way of saying that shells are programs that:
- Read the commands you type
- Evaluate those commands, usually by running other programs on your computer
- Print the output of those commands
- Give you a new prompt to type another command and repeat.

#### Assignment
