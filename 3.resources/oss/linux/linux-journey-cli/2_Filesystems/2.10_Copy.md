Copy command does what you would expect: copies a file from one location to another.

``` bash
cp source_file.txt destination/
```

You can  also copy a dir and all of its contents recursively by adding ```-R``` flag:

``` bash
cp -R my_dir new_dir
```

#### Assignment

Next,  look inside the ```backups``` dir inside of ```transactions``` 
Copy the missing file from the ```transactions``` dir into the ```backups``` dir so theres a backup of all txs.
