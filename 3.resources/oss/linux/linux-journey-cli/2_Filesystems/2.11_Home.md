In a Unix-like OS, a user's home directory is where their personal files are stored. 
It is also the directory that a user starts in when logging into the system.

I recommend doing all of your development work in your home dir.

#### Danger
Many other dirs are critical to the operating system or other programs.  Be careful when
working in other directories like ```/bin``` ```/etc``` ```/var``` .
You can mess up your system if you're not careful.

#### The ```~``` Alias
My home directory (on Mac) is located at ```/users/wagsLane```.
The ```~``` character is an alias for your home directory.
So when I want to go home you can just type ```cd ~```
