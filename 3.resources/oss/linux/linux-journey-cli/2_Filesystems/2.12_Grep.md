How to search when you are working on a terminal. 
Searching for files on the CLI can be way faster .

The [grep](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/grep-command-in-linux-unix) command allows you to search for text in files.
It has a ton of capability, and we'll be scratching the surface.

#### Basic Usage
The most basic usage of ```grep``` is to search for a string in a file. 
If we wanted to search for the word "hello" in file ```hello.txt```

``` bash
grep "hello" hello.txt
```

This will print out every line in ```hello.txt``` that contains the word "hello".
It's case-sensitive search!!

#### Extra Usages
#### Colorizing Grep results 
``` bash
grep --color "string" some_file.txt
```

#### Search for a string in your current dir and all subdirs
``` bash
grep -r "string" *
# or on another dir
grep -r "string" other_dir
```

#### Search ignoring case sensitivity
``` bash
grep -i "string" some_file.txt
```

#### Count of lines where strings are matched
``` bash
# this output will give u a number
grep -c "string" some_file.txt

# this output will give u numbered lines
grep -n "string" some_file.txt
```

#### Assignment
Apps often write their logs to filees on disk.
These logs can contain useful info about what app is doing.
Also used to debug problems.
Use ```grep``` command to find any lines with the 'CRITICAL' all caps in 
```worldbanc/private/logs/2024-01-10.log``` file.
