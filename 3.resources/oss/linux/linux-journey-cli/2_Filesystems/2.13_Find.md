The ```find``` command is a powerful tool for finding files and directories by name, not contents

#### Find a File by Name
looking for a file named ```hello.txt``` in ```some_directory```
``` bash
find some_directory -name hello.txt
```

#### Pattern Search
The ```find``` command can also search for files that match a pattern. 
To find all files that end in ```.txt``` 

```bash
find some_dir -name "*.txt"
```

```*``` asterisk is a wildcard that matches anything.
When you're trying to find filenames that contain a specific word, you can use ```*``` to match rest of filename

``` bash
# Find all files that contain the word "chad"
find some_directory -name "*name*"
```

#### Assignment
Use the ```find``` command to search the ```worldbanc/public/products``` directory for all files 
that contain the word "joint" in their name
