#### What is a Filesystem
All the data stored on your computer is organized into files and directories.
Files and directories are organized into a tree-like structure called a filesystem.
- Directories same as folders
- Files are just a dump of raw binary data: 1 and 0.
	- The bytes in a file can represent anything: text, images, videos, etc.

The filesystem tree starts with a single directory called rood directory.
The root directory contains files and directories, which can contain more files and dirs.

When you open your terminal, your working directory (the one you are in) is going to be ... somewhere.
Most commonly it is your "home" directory

#### Assignment
You've just remotely logged onto a suspicious employee's machine at WorldBanc.
First, you need to determine where on their filesystem you are...

Run ```pwd``` to print working directory.
