The output of your ```pwd``` command is a filepath. 
A filepath is a string that describes the location of a file or dir on your computer.
Yours should look something like this:
```
/users/softfork
```

The text might be different, but the structure should be the same.

- The first slash ```/``` represents the root directory. It's the top of the filesystem tree.
- The next part ```users``` is the name of a dir inside the root dir.
- And so on

#### Assignment
Time to start digging for evidence
Copypasta the command and run it to download the ```worldbanc``` directory from github
It contains files and dirs that you'll need throughout the course.

```
curl -L https://github.com/bootdotdev/worldbanc/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o worldbanc.zip
unzip worldbanc.zip
rm worldbanc.zip
mv worldbanc-main worldbanc
sudo chown -R $(whoami) worldbanc
sudo chmod -R 755 worldbanc
```
