In the following directory structure:
```
vehicles
├── cars
│   ├── fords
│   │   ├── mustang.txt
│   │   └── focus.txt
```

When inside top-level ```vehicles``` directory, the relative path to ```mustang.txt``` file is:
```
cars/ford/mustang.txt
```

When inside ```fords``` :
```
mustang.txt
```

#### Absolute Paths
A path that starts at the root of the filesystem.
The root is denoted by ```/``` 
So if ```vehicles``` dir is in the filesystem root, the absolute path is:
```
/vehicles/cars/fords/mustang.txt
```
