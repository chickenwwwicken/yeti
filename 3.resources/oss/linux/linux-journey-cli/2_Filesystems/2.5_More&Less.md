The more and less commands let you view the contents of a file one page (or line) at a time.
As the adage goes ```less``` is ```more```.

In the context of these commands, ```less``` is literally ```more```. 
The ```less``` command does everything that the ```more``` command does + features.
As a general rule, you should use ```less``` instead of ```more```.

You would only use ```more``` if you're on a system that doesn't have ```less``` installed.

#### Assignment
1. Run ```less``` and pass in the path to the ```2023.csv``` file, located at the root in the ```worldbanc/private/transactions``` dir
``` bash
less 2023.csv
```

Notice you're in an interactive mode (no shell prompt)
```less```  has taken over terminal window.

2. Press ```enter``` a few times to scroll down
3. Press "q" to exit the ```less``` program
4. Re-run the ```less``` command, but this time pass in the ```-N``` flag.

```  bash
less -N  file.csv
```
