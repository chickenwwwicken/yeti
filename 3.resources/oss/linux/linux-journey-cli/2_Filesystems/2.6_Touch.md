The touch command is designed to update the access and modification timestamps of a file.
By default, if the specified file does not exist, ```touch``` will create an empty file with given  filename.
Because of this, you'll often see this command used to quickly create new files.

``` bash
touch new_file.txt
```

You can also create multiple files at once by  listing them:

``` bash
touch new_file.txt new_file2.txt
```

```touch``` can be very handy when writing scripts because it ensures certain files exist without altering existing ones, creating new files only if necessary.

### Touch multiple files

```bash
touch file{1..10}.txt
```
