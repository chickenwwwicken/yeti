A directory is just a location in a filsystem that can contain files and other directories. 
On some systems, dirs are called "folders", but it's the same thing.

#### The MKDir command
The make directory command creates a new directory inside the current directory

``` bash
mkdir new_dir
```

#### Assignment
During your digging, you find that  a file appears to be out of place. 
Make sure you're in the ```worldbanc/publib/products/credit_cards``` dir.
Run ```ls``` from there.
You should see a file called "tbills.txt".
Treasury Bills (T-Bills) are a type of investment, not a credit card.
Inside the ```products``` directory, create a new dir called "investments".

Once you've done that, from inside the ```products``` directory run ```ls```
