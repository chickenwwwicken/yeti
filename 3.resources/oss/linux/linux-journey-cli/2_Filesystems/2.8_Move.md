Move command moves a file or directory from one location to another. 
You can use it to rename a file or to move it to a different directory altogether.
Your working directory can't be the directory you're moving.

``` bash
# Change name
mv some_file.txt some_other_name.txt
```

``` bash
# move file
mv some_file.txt path/to/new/file/
```
