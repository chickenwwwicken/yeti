Remove command deletes a file or empty dir
``` bash
rm some_file.txt
```

You can optionally add a ```-r``` flag to tell the ```rm``` command to delete a directory and all of its contents recursively.
Recursively means "do it again on all of the subdirs and their contents"
``` bash
rm -r some_dir
```

#### Assignment
Change dirs into ```worldbanc/private``` using ```cd```
Use the ```cat``` command to view the contents of ```worldbanc/private/passwords/passwords.txt``` 
Looks like someone is storing passwords in plain text.
Even on a private machine this is big sec risk.
Delete both the ```passwords``` dir and the ```passwords.txt``` file within it.
