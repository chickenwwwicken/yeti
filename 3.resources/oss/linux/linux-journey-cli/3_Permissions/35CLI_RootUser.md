The "root" user is a superuser.
It has access to everything on the system and can do anything.
When you use the ```sudo``` command, you're running as the root user.

The ```sudo``` keyword is convenient because it quickly gives you elevated permissions to run
a single command.

It can also be dangerous because it gives you access to everything.
If you run a command with ```sudo``` that you don't understand, you could do serious damage.
