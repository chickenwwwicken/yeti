Flags are options that you can pass to a command to change its behavior.

For example, the ```ls``` command can take a ```-l``` flag to show a "long" listing of files:

```
ls -l
```

The ```ls``` command can also take a ```-a``` flag to show "all" files including hidden files:

```
ls -a
```

You can combine flags:

```
ls -al
```

#### Conventions
Whether or not a command takes flags, and what those flags are, is up to the dev of the
command.
That said there are some common conventions:

- Single-character flags are prefixed with a single dash
- Multi-character flags are prefixed with two dashes
- Sometimes the same flag can be used with a single dash or two dashes (```-h``` or ```--help```) 

#### Assignment
Use the ```wc``` (wordcount) command to count the number of bytes in the ```worldbanc/public/pr_ideas.txt``` file. 
Use the ```man``` command to figure out which flag to use.

Paste the number of bytes into output field
