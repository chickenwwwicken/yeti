Programming languages have functions, and functions take arguments. 
For example, this Python function takes two arguments: ```xp``` and ```level```:

``` python
def print_player(xp, level):
	print("Player has", xp, "xp and is level", level)
```

It can then be called with two arguments:

``` python
print_player(100, 2)
# Player has 100xp and is level 2
```

In a shell, commands (programs) can also take arguments.
For example, the ```cd``` command takes a single argument (the dir to change to):

``` bash
cd /home/wagslane
```

Other commands might take multiple arguments.  
For example, the ```mv``` command takes two arguments: 
- the file to move
- the destination to move it to:

``` bash
mv file.txt newfile.txt 
```

#### Assignment
Take a look inside the ```worldbanc/public/``` directory.
```cat```  the contents of the suspicious-looking ```key.txt``` file.
This looks like some kind of private key... why is it in public?

[Move](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=m-mv-command) it from ```worldbanc/public/key.txt``` file to ```worldbanc/private/```.
