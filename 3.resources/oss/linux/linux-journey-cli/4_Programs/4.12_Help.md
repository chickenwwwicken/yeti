Most production-ready CLI tools have a "help" option that will print useful info for use.
It's usually accessed with one of the following:
- ```--help``` (flag)
- ```-h``` (flag)
- ```help``` (first positional argument)

The "help" output is often easier to parse than a full ```man``` page.
It's usually more of a quick start guide than a full manual.
