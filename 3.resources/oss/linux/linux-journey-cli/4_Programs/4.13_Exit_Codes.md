[Exit codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status) also called "return codes" or "status codes" are how programs communicate
back whether they ran successfully or not.

```0``` is the exit code for success. 
Any other exit code is an error. 
9/10 times, if a non-zero exit code is returned (meaning an error) it will be ```1``` ,
which is the catch all error code.

Programs that call other  programs use error codes to figure out if execution was successful. 
For example, if the Boot.dev server program exits with a non-zero exit code, 
we have another program that will automatically restart it and log the error. 

In a shell, you can access the exit code of the last program you ran with the question mark
For example, if you run a program that exits with a non-zero code, you can see what it was with the ```echo``` command:

``` bash
echo $?
```

#### Assignment
Commands will usually exit with error codes if they've been run without the proper arguments or configuration. 
For example, the ```private/bin/warn.sh``` script will exit with a non-zero code if you don't have the required environment variables set.

Run the ```warn.sh``` script without setting the two environment variables:
- ```WARN_MESSAGE```
- ```WARN_FROM_NAME```

Run the ```echo``` command to see the exit code.
