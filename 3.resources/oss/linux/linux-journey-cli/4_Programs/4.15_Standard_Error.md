Usually called "stderr", is the same thing as standard output, but for error messages.
It's a stream completely separate from stdout so that you can redirect it to a dif place, 
but by default, it prints to your terminal just like stdout. 

#### Redirecting Streams
You can redirect stdout and stderr to different places using the ```>``` and ```2>``` operators. 
```>``` redirects stdout
```2>``` redirects stderr.

##### Redirect stdout to a file

``` bash
echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
cat hello.txt
# Hello World
```

##### Redirect stderr to a file

``` bash
cat doesnotexist.txt 2> error.txt
cat error.txt
# cat: doesnotexist.txt: No such file or dir
```

#### Assignment
There is a ```process_transactions.sh``` script in the ```worldbanc/private/bin``` dir.
- It accepts a path to a transactions CSV file as positional argument
- It prints modern transactions (after the year 2000) to stdout
- It prints old transactions (before the year 2000) to stderr
Run the script and pass it the path to the  ```2020.csv``` file in the ```worldbanc/private/transactions``` directory.
Be sure to redirect stderr to a temporary file called ```/tmp/worldbanc.log```
