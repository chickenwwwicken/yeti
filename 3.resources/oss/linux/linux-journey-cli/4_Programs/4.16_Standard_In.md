Usually called "standard in" or "stdin", is the default place where programs read their input.
It's just a stream of data that programs can read form as they run.

All programming languages have a simple way to read from stdin
In Python is the ```input``` function:

``` python
# execution stops until the user types
# something (in this case "Lane") and presses enter
name = input("What is your name? ")

print("Hello,", name)
# Hello, Lane!
```

#### Assignment
Run the ```worldbanc/private/bin/worldbanc.sh``` program again. 
Notice that it makes use of the stdin command which is ```read``` 

example:

``` bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "Welcome to the worldbanc CLI tool!"

echo "Please enter your name:"
read NAME

echo "Please enter your email:"
read EMAIL

echo "============================================"
echo "Your name is $NAME and your email is $EMAIL"
echo "Your response has not been recorded because this is just a local script."
echo "Goodbye!"

```
