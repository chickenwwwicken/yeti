One of the most beautiful things about the shell is that you can [```pipe```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29) the output of one program into the input of another program. 
With this one simple concept, you can run incredibly powerful automation tasks.

#### Pipe
The pipe operator is ```|``` .
The pipe operator takes the stdout of the program on the left and "pipis" it into the stdin
program on the right.

``` bash
echo "Have you heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?" | wc -w
# 10
```

```echo``` command sends "Have you heard" to stdout.
However instead of that being sent to terminal...
It was sent to the ```wc``` (word count) command.
The ```wc``` command counts the number of words in the input it receives. 
This only works because the ```wc``` command, like most shell commands can optionally read from stdin instead of a filepath.

#### Assignment
We need to figure out just how many transactions "Bob" has been involved in.
Use the ```grep``` command to find all lines in all of the transactions that include "Bob".
You'll want to include all of the files in the ```worldbanc/private/transactions``` dir, but not backups.
Use the ```--exclude-dir``` flag. 

``` bash
grep -R "Bob" PATH_TO_TRANSACTIONS --exclude-dir="backups"
```

Then, pipe the output of that command into the ```wc -l``` command to count the number of lines.
