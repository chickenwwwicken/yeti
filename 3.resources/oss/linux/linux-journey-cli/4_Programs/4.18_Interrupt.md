Sometimes a program will get stuck and you'll want to stop it.
Common reasons for this are:
- You made a typo in the command and it's not doing what you want
- It's trying to access the internet but you're not connected
- It's processing too much data and you don't want to wait
- There is a bug in the program causing it to hang

In these cases, you can stop the program by pressing ```ctrl + c``` 
This sends a "SIGINT" signal to the program, which tells it to stop.

#### Assignment
Inside the ```worldbanc/private/bin/``` dir, there is a program called ```malicious.sh```
Run it.
It will run forever if you let it... run ```ctrl + c``` to send a ```SIGINT``` signal to stop.
