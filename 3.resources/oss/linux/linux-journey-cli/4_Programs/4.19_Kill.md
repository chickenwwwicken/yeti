Sometimes a program is in such a bad state (or is malicious)
That it doesn't respond to the ```SIGINT```, in which case the best option is to use another shell 
session (new terminal window) to manually [kill](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=k-kill-command) the program.

#### Syntax

``` bash
kill PID
```

```PID``` stands for "Process ID" 
Every process that's running on your machine has a unique ID.
The ```ps``` "process status" command can be used to list the processes running on your machine.

``` bash
ps aux
```

The "aux" options just mean "show all processes, including those owned by other users, and show extra information about each process".

#### Assignment
Run the program again in force mode:

``` bash
./malicious.sh force
```

Try to kill the program with  ```ctrl + c```
Open a second terminal window.
Pipe the output of ```ps aux``` into ```grep``` to find the process ID of the malicious program. 
grep for ```malicious.sh``` 
You will get two results:
- one for the malicious program
- one for the ```grep``` command itself.
Make sure you use the correct PID, and that you don't miss any characters.
You don't want to accidentally kill a system-critical process.

Once you have the PID (it should just be a number like "93838")
Kill it:

```
kill PID
```

Once you killed the program, you should see your original terminal window. 

#### TIP
run ```ps aux | head -n 1``` to see the header row of the ps aux table.
