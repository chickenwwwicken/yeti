A program is just a set of instructions that a computer can execute.
We talked about executables in the last lesson (just a file that contains a program).
Broadly speaking there are two types of programs:
- Compiled programs
- Interpreted Programs

#### Compiled Programs
A compiled program is a program that has been converted from human-readable source code into machine code (binary).
Machine code is a set of instructions that a computer can execute directly: 
your computer's CPU is hardware that's been designed to execute machine code.

Programming languages like Go, C, and Rust are compiled languages that produce compiled programs.

#### Interpreted Programs
An interpreted program is a program that is executed by another program.
The program that executes the interpreted program is called an interpreter.
The interpreter reads the source code of the interpreted program and executes it.

Programming languages like Python, Ruby and Javascript, are intepreted languages.
Your computer needs to have an interpreter installed to run programs written in those languages.

Another example is the ```.sh``` shell script files we talked about. 
Those are interpreted by the shell program.

#### Assignment
In your shell, run the following command:
``` bash
which sh
```

The which command tells you the location of an installed command line program.
In this case, we're asking for the location of the ```sh```  (shell) program.
