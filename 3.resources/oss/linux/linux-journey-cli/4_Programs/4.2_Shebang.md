As we talked about before, you can run any executable file by typing its filepath.
That worksout-of-the-box for files that are compiled executables.
But what about scripts that need to be interpreted by another program?
The computer needs to be told what program to use to interpret the file.

A "shebang" is a special line at the top of a script that tells your shell which program to use.
The format of a shebang is:

```
#! interpreter [optinal-arg]
```

For example, if your script is a Python script and you want to use Python 3, your shebang is:

```
#! /usr/bin/python3
```

This tells the system to use Python 3 located at ```/usr/bin/python3```

#### Assignment
Use the ```cat```  or ```less``` command to view the contents of the ```private/bin/genids.sh``` file.
Paste the shebang into the input field and submit your answer.
