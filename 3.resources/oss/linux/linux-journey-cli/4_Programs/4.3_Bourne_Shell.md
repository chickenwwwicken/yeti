Difference between the 3 shells
- ```sh``` - The Bourne shell. This is the original Unix shell and is POSIX-compliant. It's very basic and doesn't have many quality-of-life features.
- ```bash``` - The Bourne Again shell. This is the most popular shell on Linux. It builds on sh, but also has a lot of extra features.
- ```zsh``` - The Z shell. This is the most popular shell on macOS. Like bash, it does what sh can do, but also has a lot of extra features.
Both ```zsh``` and ```bash``` are "sh-compatible" shells, meaning the can run ```.sh``` scripts, but they also have extra features that generally make them more pleasant to use. 
Differences between ```zsh``` and ```bash``` are not super significant.
