Bash and Zsh both have configuration files that run automatically each time you start a new 
shell session.
These files are used to set up your shell environment.
They can be used to set up aliases, functions, and environment variables.

These files are located in your home directory (```~```) and are hidden by default.
- If you're using Bash, ```.bashrc``` is probably the file you want to edit.
- For Zsh, probably ```.zshrc``` 

#### Assignment
As part of your audit, you're trying to figure out what shell commands are run automatically
when a user logs in on the machine. 
You need to confirm which shell configuration file is being used

Edit the file you believe to be your shell configuration file.
You can use the ```nano``` command to edit files in your shell.

``` bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```
