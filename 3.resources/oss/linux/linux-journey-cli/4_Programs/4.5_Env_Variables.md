``` bash
name="chicken"
echo $name
# chicken
```

There is another type of variable called [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable).
They are available to all programs that you run in your shell.

You can view all of the environment variables that are currently set in your shell with ```env```.

If you want to set a variable in your shell, you can use the ```export``` command:

``` bash
export NAME="chicken"
```

For example we can create a file called ```introduce.sh```

``` bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "sup im chicken"
```

Give it execution permissions:

``` bash
chmod +x ./introduce.sh

./introduce.sh
```

#### Assignment
Take a look at the contents of the ```warn.sh``` script in ```worldbanc/private/bin``` dir.
It looks like it's supposed to print nicely formatted warning messages.

```export``` the required environment variables:
- ```WARN_MESSAGE```: "The auditor is here"
- ```WARN_FROM_NAME```: "Your worst nightmare"
Run the script and paste the output.
