In the last lesson, we changed your ```PATH``` variable for your current shell session. 
Trouble is, the next time you restart your shell, it will be reset.
You won't be able to use the ```worldbanc``` CLI Tool from anywhere unless you change it
permanently.

The most common way to do this is to add the same ```export``` command that we used
last lesson to your shell's configuration file.

#### Assignment
Edit your ```.bashrc``` file and add an ```export``` command to the end of the file that adds the
```worldbanc/private/bin``` dir to your ```PATH``` variable.

Once you've done that restart your shell

Then run the ```worldbanc.sh``` CLI tool again from your home dir.
