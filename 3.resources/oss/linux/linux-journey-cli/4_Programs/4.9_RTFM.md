The man command is short for "manual".
It's a program that displays the manual for  other programs.

I know that manuals and documentation can feel intimidating.
That said, manuals and documentation should become more useful as u get more exp.
They not as scare as they seem when you actually read them.

#### Using Man
The ```man``` command will only work for programs that it has a manual for, but most built-
in commands and Unix programs are supported.
You just pass the name of the command you want to read the manual for as an argument.
The most intuitive place of course, is reading the manual manual:

```
man man
```

#### Searching
Most people don't just read man pages for fun. 
More often the manual is used as a reference to quickly look up usage or special flags.

You can search for text in the manual by pressing the ```/``` key and typing your search,
then pressing enter

#### Assignment
As a systems person, the ```grep``` command is going to be your best friend.
It can be a little confusing to use.
Open its manual.

Manual is an interactive session.
You can page through the manual with the spacebar, and quit with ```q```
