Use Neovim to open the ```worldbanc/public/company_info.md``` file.
You can open a file with neovim passing in the file path as argument

``` bash
nvim file/to/path.md
```

Once it's open, you might notice that you can't type.
You are in "normal" mode, the mode for navigating and manipulating text.
Use the arrow keys to move your cursor down to the last line.

```i``` to enter "insert" mode. (```-- INSERT --```) will appear at bottom.
Replace the password with the text "REDACTED"

```esc``` to return to normal mode
```:w``` and press enter to save changes
```:q``` and press enter to quit NeoVim
