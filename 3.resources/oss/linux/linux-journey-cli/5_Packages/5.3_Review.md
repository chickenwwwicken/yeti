#### How does it work
When you type a command like ```apt install neovim```, the package manager will:
1. Check to see if the package is already installed
2. If it's not installed, it will download the package from a repo
3. It will install the package on your computer
4. It will install any dependencies that the package needs to run.
5. It will (hopefully) add the package to your PATH if it should be there.

Good package managers keep track of what packages you have installed,
and what versions of those packages you have installed.
They keep your filesystem nice and tidy,
making sure you don't install 10 different instances of the same app or package.

For your edification, take a look at where your package manager installed ```nvim```

``` bash
which nvim
```
