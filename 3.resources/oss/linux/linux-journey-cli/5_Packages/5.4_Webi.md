Also known as [webinstall.dev](https://webinstall.dev/) 

Webi lets you install command line tools directly from the web,
with no need for a local command line tool like ```apt``` or ```brew``` .
You don't need to install webi itself at all, instead 
you just run a shell command that downloads and runs the tool's official installer script.

#### Assignment
Let's install [lsd](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd) , a modern version of the ```ls``` command. 
It's essentially ```ls``` with a bunch of extra features.

Go to Webi and look for the ```lsd (LSDeluxe)``` entry. 
Navigate to its page and select the correct instructions to install it on your system
You should simply need to copy pasta and run a single command in your terminal.

Make sure ```lsd``` works by listing all the files in the ```worldbanc/private/transactions``` dir
One of the coolest features of ```lsd``` is that you can view your files in a tree-like structure.
Try running ```lsd``` with the ```--tree``` flag on the ```worldbanc/private``` directory.

Finally run it again with both ```--tree``` and ```--classic``` flags on 
the ```worldbanc/private/transactions``` directory

Install the [nerdfont](https://webinstall.dev/nerdfont/) and update the font in your terminal's settings for ```lsd``` to show icons.
