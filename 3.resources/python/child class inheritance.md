To override a method from the parent class, you simply define a method with the same name in the child class. For example:

``` python
class DebounceStack(Stack):
    def some_method(self, param):
        # Your new implementation here
        pass
```

If you want to call the parent class's implementation of a method from within the child class, you useÂ `super()`:

``` python
class DebounceStack(Stack):
    def some_method(self, param):
        # Do something before
        super().some_method(param)
        # Do something after
```
