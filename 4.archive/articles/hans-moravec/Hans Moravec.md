born November 30, 1948, Kautzen, Austria is computer scientist and an adjunct faculty member at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, USA. Known for his work on Robotics, AI, and writings on the impact of technology. Moravec also is a futurist with many of his publications and predictions focusing on transhumanism. Developed techniques in computer vision for determining the [[region of interest]] (ROI) in a scene. 

### Predictions
By estimating the computational cost (measured in instructions per second) of various operations of human intelligence, and comparing it with the future of computer computational power as predicted by [[Moore's Law]].

In *When will computer hardware match the human brain* (1998) he estimated that human brains operate at about 10^15
instructions per second, and that, if Moore's law continues, a computer with the same speed would cost only 1000 USD in mid-2020s, thus "Computers suitable for humanlike robots will appear in the mid 2020s".

*Mind Children* 1988: prediction of robots in 2030-2040s

*Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind* 1999: further considers the implications of evolving robot intelligence, generalizing Moore's law to technologies predating the integrated circuit, and extrapolating it to predict a coming "mind fire" of rapidly expanding superintelligence. Robot has been called the most awesome work of controlled imagination ever encountered.
