Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in an Integrated circuit doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and a projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship. It is an experience-curve law, a type of law quantifying efficiency gains from experience in production. 

The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, who in 1965 noted that the number of components per integrated circuit had been doubling each year, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade.
