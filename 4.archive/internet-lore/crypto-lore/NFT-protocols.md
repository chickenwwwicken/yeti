# 1. Colored Coins (2012):: 
Colored coins were the first attempt to create NFTs on Bitcoion. They used a combination oof OP_RETURN and OP_CHECKSIG to attach arbitrary data to Bitcoin transactioons. 

Open source protoocol that allow susers too represent and manipulate immutable digital resources on top of Bitcoin transactions. The are a class f methods for representing and mantaining real-woorld assets on the Bitcoin bloockchain.

Coolored coins are bitcoins with a mark on them that specifies what they may be used for. One could argue that clored coins are the very first NFTs to exist. Colored Coins are made oof small denominations oof a bitcoin and can be as small as a single satoshi, the smallest unit of a bitcoin. Colored Cins can be uused to represent a multitude of assets and have multiple use cases, including;

- property
- coupons
- ability to issue your own cryptocurrency
- issue shares of a company
- access tookens 
- digital collectibles

The earliest mention of Colored coins appears to be form a blog post in 2012 by Yoni Assia "Bitcoin 2.X" sounds familiar.

Assia claims that since Colored coins are bitcoins that were part of the 'Genesis Transaction' they are unique and identifiable from regular bitcoin transactions. Also sounds familiar. 

Meni Rosenfeld created the Colored Coins whitepaper detailing the concept on Dec 4, 2012

Assia then collaborated with Buterin, Lior Hakim, and Meni Rosenfeld, Amos Meiri, Alex mizrahi and Rotem Lev to write [BitcoinX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoinx/) [BitcoinX-github](https://github.com/bitcoinx-project/bcx.org/blob/master/images/logo/logo.svg

# 2. Counterparty

*Writing in the margins* of Regular Bitcoin TXs

You can create a RarepepeWallet [here](https://www.counterparty.io/)
Also a Casa Tookan multi-chain wallet as the official Spells of Genesis Game, allows players to manage SoG assets aloongside other Counterparty and ETH tokens


### 2014
Counterparty was founded in 2014 by Robert Dermody, Adam Krellenstein, and Evan Wagner.

It's a peer-to-peer financial platform and distributed, open-source Internet protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. 

With a native DEX and token, Counterparty was built ontop of Bitcoin network to let users mind, buym and sell unique digital assets.

#####  How does it work?
Counterparty is like a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. 

A platform buil on top of Bitcoin that inherits the security of the original blockchain, but provides additional functionality like smart contracts. all wrapped up in a bitcoin transaction. 

Counterparty nodes simply interpret the data in these transactions based on specific rules from the protocol. 
The protoocol creates its own ledger of related TXs (transactions) that it has identified on Bitcoin network. 

Counterparty nodes don't ooffer a peer to peer network. While they all share same code and receive the same tx data, primary role oof CP nodes is to coonnect to the Bicoin Software.
