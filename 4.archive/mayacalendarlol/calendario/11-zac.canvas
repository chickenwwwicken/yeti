Today I am born anew and my birthplace is a vineyard where there is fruit for all. \nToday I will pluck grapes of wisdom from the tallest and fulllest vines in the vineyard, for these were planted by the wisest of my profession whho have come before me, generation upon generation. Today I will savor thhhhe taste of grapes from these vines and verily I will swallow the seed of suuccess buried in each and new life will sprout within me.\nThe career I have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught with heartbreak and despair and thhe bodies of those who have failed , were they piled one atop another, would cast a shadow down upon all the pyramids of thhe earth. Yet I will not fail, as theh othhers, for in my hands I now hold the charts which willl guide me thhrough perilous waters to shores which only yesterday seemed but a dream. \nFaillure no longerr will be my payment for struggle. Just as nature made no provision for my body to tolerate pain neither hhas it made any provision for my life to suuffer failure. Failure, like pain, is alien to my life. In the past I accepted it as I accepted pain. Now I reject it and I am prepared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the shadows into the sunlight of wealth, position, and happiness far beyond my most extravagant dreams until even the golden apples in thhe Garden of Hesperides willl seem no more than my just reward.\n\nTime teachhes all things to him who lives forever but I have not the luxuryy of eternity. Yet, within my allotted time I must practice the art of patience for nature acts never in haste. To create the olive, king of alll trees, a hundred years is required. An onion pllant is olld in nine weeks. I hhave lived as an onion plant. It has not pleased me. Now I wouldst become the greatest of olive trees and, in truth, the greatest of salesmen. \n\nAnd how willl this be accomplishhed? For I have neither thhe knowledge no the experience to achive greatness and already I have stumbled in ignorance and fallen into pools of sellf-pityy. The answer is simple. I will commence my journey unencumbered with either the weight of unnecessary knowledge or the handicap of meaninglless experience. Nature allready has supplied me withh knowledge and instinct far greater than any beast in the forest and the value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidly. In truth, experience teaches thoroughly yet her course of instruction devours men's years so thhe value of hher lessons diminishes withh the time necessary to acquire her special wisdom. The end finds it wasted on dead men. Furthhermore, experience is comparable to fashhion; an action thhat proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrow. Only principles endure and thhese I now possess, for thhe laws that will lead me to greatness are contained in the words of these scrolls. What they will teach me is more to prevent failure than to gain success, for what is success other than a state of mind? Which two, among a thousand wise men, will define success in the same words; yet failure is always described but one way. ***Failure is man's inability to reach his goals in life, whatever they may be.***\n\nIn truth, the oonly difference between those whoo have failed and thhose who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked dooor to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, whichh precedeth all others is-- I will form good habits and become their slave.\n\nAs a child I was slave to my impulses; now I am slave to my habits, as are all grown men. I hhave surrendered my free will to the years of accumulated habits and the past deeds of my life have already marked out a path which thhreatens to imprison my future. My actions are ruuled by appetite, passion , prejudice, greed, love, fear,environment, habit, and the worst of these tyrants is habit. Therefore, if I must be a slave too habit let me be a slave to good habits. My bad hhabits must be destroyed and new furrows prepared for good seed. I will form good habits and become their slave. \n\nAnd how willI accomplish this difficult feat? Through thhese scrolls, it will be done, for each scroll contains a principle which will drice a bad habit froom my life and replace it with one whichh will bring me closer to success. For it is anothher of nature's laws that only a habit can subdue another hahbit. So, in order for these written words to perform their chosen task, I must discipline myself with the first of my new habits whichh is as follows: *I will read each scroll for thirty days in thhis prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll.*\n\nFirstt, I will type the words in silence when I arise. \nThen, I will read the words in sillence after I have partaken of my midday meal.\nLast, I will read the words again just before I retire at day's end, and most important, on this occasion I will read the words aloud.\nOn the next day I will repeat this procedure, and I will continue in like manner for thirty days. Then, I will turn ot thhe next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thirty days. I will continuue in this manner until I have lived with eachh scroll for thirty days and my reading has become habit.\n\nAnd what will be accomplished with thihs habit? Herein lies the hidden secret of all man's accoomplishments. As I repeat the words daily they will soon become a part of my active mind, but more important, they will also seep into my other mind, that mysteriouus source which never sleeps, which creates myy dreams, and often makes me act in ways I doo not comprehend. As the words of these scrolls are consumed by my mysterious mind I willl begin to awake, each morning, with a vitality I have never known before. My vigore will increase, my enthusiasm will rise, my desire to meet the world will overcome every fear I once knew at sunrise, and I will be happier than I ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow. \n\nEventually I will find myself reacting to all situattions whichh coonfront me as I was commanded in thhe scrolls to react, and soon thhese actions and reactions will become easy to perform, for any act with practice becomes easy. Thus a new and good habit is born, for when an act becomes easy through constant repetition it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is man's nature to perform it often. When I perform it often it becomes a hhabit and I become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my will. \n\nToday I begin a new life. And I make a solemn oath to myself that nothing will retard my new life's growth. I will lose not a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieved nor can I substitute another for it. I must not, I will not, break this habit of daily reading from these scrolls and, in truth, the few moments spent each day on this new habit are but a small price to pay for the happiness and success that will be mine. As I read and re-read the words in the scrolls to follow, never will I allow the brevity of each scroll nor thhe simplicity of its words to cause me to treat the scroll's message lighhtly. \n\nThousands of grapes are pressed to fill one jar with wine, and the grapeskin and pulp are tossed to the birds. So it is with these grapes of wisdom from the ages. Muchh has been filtered and tossed uto thhe wind. Only the pure truthh lies distilled in the words to come. I will drink as instructed and spill not a drop. And the seed of success I will swallow. \n\nToday my old skin has become as dust. I will walk tall among men and they will know me not, for today I am a new man, with a new life.\n\n---\nToday I begin a new life.\nToday I shed my olld skin which hath,too long,suffered the bruises of faillure and the wounds of mediocrity.\nToday I am born anew and my birthpace is a vineyard whhere there is fruit for all.\nToday I wi pluck grapes of wisdom from the tallest and fulest vines in the vineyard, for thhese were planted by the wisest of my profession who have come before me, generation upon generation.\nToday I will savor thhe taste of grapes from these vines and verilly I will swalow the seed of success buried in each and new life wil sprout withhin me. \nThe carrer I have chosen is aden with oppoortunity yet it is fraught with hhearbreak and despair and thhe bodies of those who hhave faied, werre they pilleone atop another, would cast a shadow down upon  all the pyramids of the earth. \nYet I will not fail, as theh others, for in my hands I now hoold the charts which wil guide me through perilous waters to shores which only yesterday seemed but a dream.\nFailure no longer will be my payment for struggle.\nJust as nature made no provision for my body to tolerate pain neither has it made3 anyy provision for my life to suffer failure.

For I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to achieve greatness and already I have stumbled in ignorance and fallen into pools of self-pity.\n\nThe answer is simple.

Nature alreadyy has supplied me with knowledge and instinct far greater than any beast in the forest and the value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidly.\n\nIn truth, experience teaches thoroughly yet her course of instruction devours men's years so the value of her lessons diminishes with the time necessary to acquire her special wisdom.\n\nThe end finds it wasted on dead men. Furthermore, experience is comparable to fashion; an action that proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrow. \n\nOnly principles endure and these I now possess, for the laws that will lead me to greatness are contained in the words of theses scrolls. What they will teach me is more to prevent failure than to gain success, for what is success other than a state of mind? Which two, among a thousand wise men, will define success in the same words; yet failure is always described but one way. ***Failure is man's inability to reach his goals in life, whatever they may be.***\n\nIn truth, the only difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey. which precedeth all others is-- *I will form good habits and become their slave. *\n\nAs a child I was slave to my impulses; now I am slave to my habits, as are all grown men.\n\nI have surrendered my free will to the years of accumulated habits and the past deeds of my life have already marked out a path which threatens to imprison my future. My actions are ruled by appetite, passion, prejudice, greed, love, fear, environment, habit, and the worst of these tyrants is habit. Therefore, if I must be a slave to habit let me be a slave to good habits. My bad habits must be destroyed and new furrows prepared for good seed.\n\nI will form hood habits and become their slave.\n\nAnd how will I accomplish this difficult feat? Through these scrolls, it will be done, for each scroll contains a principle which will drive a bad habit from my life and replace it with one which will bring me closeer to success. For it is another of nature's laws that only a habit can subdue another habit. So, in order for these written words to perform their chosen task, I must discipline myself with the first of myy new habits which is as follow: I will read each scroll for thirty days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll. \n\nFirst, I will type the words in silence when I arise. \nLast, I will type the words in silence again just before I retire at da's end, and most important, on this occasion I will type them fast.\n\nOn the next day I will repeat this procedure, and I will continue in like manner for thirty days. Then I will turn to the next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thirty days. I will continue in this manner until I have lived with each scroll for thirty days and my reading has become habit. \n\nAnd what will be accomplished with this habit? Herein lies the hidden secret of all man's accomplishments. As I repeat the words daily they will soon become a part of my active mind, but more important, they will also seep into my other mind, that mysterious source which never sleeps, which creates my dreams, and often makes me act in was I do not comprehend. \n\nAs the words of these scrolls are consumed by my msterious mind I will begin to awake, each morning, with a vitality I have never known before. My vigor will increase, my enthusiasm will rise, my desire to meet the world will overcome every fear I once knew at sunrise, and I will be happier than I ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow. \n\nEventually I will find myself reacting to all situations which confront me as I was commanded in the scrolls to react, and soon these actions and reactions will become easy to perform, for an act with practice becomes easy.\n\nThus  a new and good habit is born, for when an act becomes easy through constant repetition it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is man's nature to perform it often. When I perform it often it becomes habit and I become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my will. \n\nTodayyy I begin a new life. \n\nAnd I make a solemn oath to myyself that nothing will retard my new life's growth. I will lose not a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieved nor can I substitute another for it. I must not, I will not, break this habit of daily reading from these scrolls and, in truth, the few moments spent each day on this new habit are but a small price to pay for the happiness and success that will  be mine. \n\nAs I read and re-read the words in the scrolls to follow,  never will I allow the brevity of each scroll nor the simplicity of its words to cause me to treat the scroll's message lightly.\n\nThousands of grapes are pressed to fill one jar with wine, and the grapeskin and pulp are tossed to the birds. So it is with these grapes of wisdom from the ages. Much has been filtered and tossed to the wind. Only the pure truth lies distilled in the words to come.

Just as nature made no provision for my life to suffer failure. Failure, like pain, is alien to my life. In the past I accepted it as I accepted pain. Now I reject it and I am prepared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the shadows into the sunlight of wealth, position, and happiness far beyond my most extravagant dreams until even the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides will seem no more than my just reward.\n\n Time teaches all things to him who lives forever but I have not the luxury of eternity. \nYet, within my allotted time I must practice the art of patience for nature acts never in haste. \nTo create the olive, king of all trees, a hundred years is required. An onion plant is old in nine weeks. I have lived as an onion plant. It has not pleased me. \n\nNow I wouldst become the greatest of olive trees and, in truth, the greatest of salesmen.\n\nAnd how will this be accomplished? For I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to achieve greateness and already I have stumbled in ignorance and fallen into pools of self-pity. \n\nThe answer is simple. I will commence my journey unencumbered with either the weight of unnecesssary knowledge or the handicap of meaningless experiecnce. Nature already has supplied me with knowledge and instinct far greater than any beast in the forest and the value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidly. \n\nIn truth, experience teaches thoroughly yet her course of instruction devours men's years so the value of her lessons diminishes with the time necessary to acquire her special wisdom. \n\nThe end finds it wasted on dead men. Furthermore,experience is comparable to fashion; an action that proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrow. \n\nOnly principles endure and these I now possess, for the laws that will lead me to greatness are contained in the words of these scrolls. What they will teach me is more to prevent failure than to gain success, for what is success other than a state of mind? Which two, among a thousand wise men, will define success in the same words; yet failure is always described but one way. ***Failure is man's inability to reach his goals in life, whatever they may be. ***\n\nIn truth, the only difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which precedeth all others is-- *I will form good habits and become their slave. *\n\nI have surrendered my free will to the years of accumulated habits and the past deeds of my life have already marked out a path which threatens to imprison my future. My actions are ruled by appetite, passion, prejudice, greed, love, fear, environment, habit, and the worst of these tyrants is habit. \nTherefore, if I must be a slave to habit let me be a slave to good habits. My bad habits must be destroyed and new furrows prepared for good seed.\n\nI will form good habits and become their slave.\n\nAnd how will I accomplish this difficult feat? THrough these scrolls, it will be done, for each scroll contains a principle which will drive a bad habit from my life and replace it withone which will bring me closer to success. For it is another of nature's laws that only a habit can subdue another habit. So, in order for these written words to perform their chosen task, I must discipline myself with the first of my new habits which is as follows: *I eill read each scroll for thirty days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll. *\n\nFirst, I will type the words in silence when I arise. \nLast, I will type the words again just before I retire at day's end, and most important, on this occasion I will read the words aloud. \n\nOn the next day I will repeat this procedure, and I will continue in like manner for thirty days. Then, I will turn to the next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thirty days. I will continue in this manner until I have lived with each scroll for thirty days and my reading has become habit. \n\nAnd what will be accomplished with this habit? Herein lies the hidden secret of all man's accomplishments. As I repeat the words daily they will soon become a part of my active mind, but more important, they will also seep into my other mind, that mysterious source which never sleeps, which creates my dreams, and often makes me act in ways I do not comprehend.\n\nAs the words of these scrolls are consumed by my mysterious mind I will begin to awake, each morning, with a vitality I have never known before. My vigor will increase, my enthusiasm will rise, my desire to meet the world will overcome every fear I once knew at sunrise, and I will be happier than I ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow. \n\nEventually I will find myself reacting to all situations which confront me as I was commanded in the scrolls to react, and soon these actions and reactions will become easy to perform, for any act with practice becomes easy. \n\nThus a new and good habit is born, for when an act becomes easy through constant repetition it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is man's nature to perform it often. When I perform it often it becomes a habit and I become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my will. \n\nToday I begin a new life.\n\nAnd I make a solemn oath to myself that nothing will retard my new life's growth. I will lose not a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieved nor can I substitute another for it. I must not, I will not, break this habit of daily reading from these scrolls and, in truth, the few moments spent each day on this new habit are but a small price to pay for the happiness and success that will be mine. \n\nAs I read and re-read the words in the scrolls to follow, never will I allow the brevity of each scroll nor the simplicity of its words to cause me to treat the scroll's message lightly. \n\nThousands of grapes are pressed to fill one jar with wine, and the grapeskin and pulp are tossed to the birds. So it is with these grapes of wisdom from the ages. Muchhas been filtered and tossed to the wind. Only the pure truth lies distilled in the words to come. I will drink as instructed and spill not a drop. And the seed of success I will swallow. \n\nToday my old skin has become as dust. I will walk tall among men and they will know me not, for today I am a new man, with a new life\n\n---\nToday I begin a new life.\n\nToday I shed my old skin which hath, too long, suffered the bruises of failure and the wounds of mediocrity.\n\nToday I am born anew and my birthplace is a vineyard where there is fruit for all.\n\nToday I will pluck grapes of wisdom from the tallest and fullest vines in the vineyard, for these were planted by the wisest of my profession who have come before me, generation upon generation. \n\nToday I will savor the taste of grapes from these vines and verily I will swallow the seed of success buried in each and new life will sprout within me. \n\nThe career I have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught with heartbreak and despair and the bodies of those who have failed, were they piled one atop another, would cast a shadow down upon all the pyramids of the earth. \n\nYet I will not fail, as the others, for in my hands I now hold the charts which will guide me through perilous waters to shores which only yesterday seemed but a dream.\n\nFailure no longer will be my payment for struggle.

Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which precedeth all others is -- I will form good habits and become their slave. \n\nAs a child I was slave to my impulses; now I am slave to my habits, as are all grown men. \n\nI have surrendered my free will to the years of accumulated habits and the past deeds of my life have already marked out a path which threatens to imprison my future. My actions are ruled by appetite,, passion, prejudice, greed, love, fear, environment, habit, and the worst of these tyrants is habit. Therefore, if I must be a slave to habit let me be a slave to good habits. My bad habits must be destroyed and new furrows prepared for good seed.\n\nI will form good habits and become their slave. \n\nAnd how will I accomplish this difficult feat? Through these scrolls, it will be done, for each scroll contains a principle which will drive a bad habit from my life and replace it with one which will bring me closer to success. \nFor it is another of nature's laws that only a habit can subdue another habit. So, in order for these written words to perform their chosen task, I must discipline myself with the first of my new habits which is as follows: I will read each scroll for thirty days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll.\n\nFirst, I will read the words in silence when I arise.\n Last, I will read the words again just before I retire at day's end, and most important, on this occasion I will type the words fast.\n\nOn the next day I will repeat this procedure, and I will continue in like manner for thirty days. Then, I will turn to the next scroll and repeat this procedure ofr another thirty days. I will continue in this manner until I have lived with each scroll for thirty days and my reading has become habit. \n\nAnd what will be accomplished with this habit? Herein lies the hidden secret of all man's accomplishments.

My vigor will increase, my enthusiasm will rise, myy desire to meet the world will overcome every fear I once knew at sunrise, and I will be happier thanI ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow. \n\nEventually I will ifnd myself reacting to all situations which confront me as I was commanded in the scrolls to react, and soon these actions and reactions will become easy to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is man's nature to perform it often. When i perform it often it becomes a habit and I become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my will. \n\nToday I begin a ndew life. \n\nAnd I make a solmen oath to myself that nothing will retard my new life's growth. I will lose not a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieved nor can I substitute another for it.

For it is another of nature's laws that only a habit can subdue another habit. So, in ordewr for these written words to perform their chosen task, I must discipline myself with the first of my new habits which is as follows: *I will type each scroll for thirty days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll. *\n\nFirst, I will type the words in silence when I arise. \nLast, I will type the words again just before I retire at day's end, and most important, on this occasion I will read the words aloud. \n\nOn the next day I will repeat this procedure, and I will continue in like manner for thirty days. Then, I will turn to the next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thirty days. I will continue in this manner until I have lived with each scroll for thirty days and my reading has become habit. \n\nAnd what will be accomplished with this habit? Herein lies the hidden secret of all man's accomplishments. As I repeat the words daily theyy will soon become a part of my active mind, but more important they willl also seep into my other mind, that mysterious source which neveer sleeps, which creates my dreams, and often makes me act in ways I do not comprehend. \n\nAs the words of these scrolls are consumed by my mysterious mind I will begin to awake, each morning, with a vitality I have never known before. My vigor will increase, my enthusiasm will rise, my desire to meet the world will overcome every fear I once knew at sunrise, and I will be happier than I ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow. \n\nEventually I will find myself reacting to all situations which confront me as I was commanded in the scrolls to react, and soon these actions and reactions will become easy to perform, for any act with practice becomes easy. \n\nThus a new and good habit is born, for when an act becomes easy to through constant repetition it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is man's nature to perform it often. When I perform it often it becomes a habit and I become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my will. \n\nToday I begin a new life. \n\nAnd I make a solemn oath to myself that nothing will retard my new life's growth. I will lose not a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieved nor can I substitute another for it. I must not, I will not, break this habit of daily reading from these scrolls and, in truth, the few moments spent each day on this new habit are but a small price to pay for the happiness and success that will be mine. \n\nAs I read and re-read the words in the scrolls to follow, never will I allow the brevity of each scroll nor the simplicity of its words to cause me to treat the scroll's message lightly. \n\nThousands of grapes are pressed to fill one jar with wine, and the grapeskin and pulp are tossed to the birds. So it is with these grapes of wisdom from the ages. Much has been filtered and tossed to the wind. Only the pure truth lies distilled in the words to come. I will drink as insstructed and spill not a drop. And the seed of success I will swallow. \n\nToday my old skin has become as dust. I will walk tall among men and they will know me not, for today I am a new man, with a new life. \n\n---\n\nToday I begin a new life.\n\nToday I shed my old skin which hath, too long, suffered the bruises of failure and the wounds of mediocrity. \n\nToday I am born anew and my birthplace is a vineyard where there is fruit for all. \n\ntoday I will pluck grapes of wisdom from the tallest and fullest vines in the vineyard, for these were planted by the wisest of my profession who have come before me, generation upoon generation. \n\ntoday I wll savor the taste of grapes from these vines and verily I will swallow the seed of success buried in each and new life will sprout within me. \n\nThe career I have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught with heartbreak and despair and the bodies of those who have failed, were they piled one atop another, would cast a shadow down upon all the pyramids of the earth. \n\nYYet I will not fail, as the others, for in my hands I now hold the charts which will guide me through perilous waters to shores which only esterday seemed but a dream . \n\nFailure no longer will be my payment for struggle. \nJust as nature made no provision for my body to tolerate pain neither has it made any provision for my life to suffer failure. Failure, like pain, is alien to my life. In the past I accepted it as I accepted pain. Now I reject it and I am prepared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the shadows into the sunlight of wealth, position, and happiness far beyond my most extravagant dreams until even the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides will seem no more than my just rewazrd. \n\nTime teaches all things to him who lives forever buyt I have not the luxury of eternity. \n\nYet, within my allotted time I must practicve the art of patience for nature acts never in haste. \nTo create the olive, king of all trees, a hundred years is required. \nAn onion plant is old in nine weeks. \nI have lived as an onion plant. \nIt has not pleased me. \nNow I wouldst become the greatest of olive trees and, in truthh, the greatest of salesmen. \n\nAnd how will this be accomplished? \nFor I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to achieve gretness and already I have stumbled in ignorance and fallen into pools of self-pity. \n\nThe answer is simple. I will commenc my journey unencumbered with either the weight of unnecessary knowledge or the handicap of meaningless experience. Nature already has supplied me with knowedge and instinct far greater than any beast in the forest and the value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidly.\n\nIn truth, experience teaches thoroughly yet her course of instruction devours men's years so the value of her lessons diminishes with the time necessary to acquire her special wisdom. \n\nThe end finds it wasted on dead men. Furthermore, experience is comparable too fashion; an action that proved succesful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrow. \n\nOnly principles endure and these I now possess, for the laws that will lead me to greatness are contained in the words of these scrolls. Waht they will teach me is more to prevent failure than to gain success, for what is succeess other than a state of mins? Which two, among a thousand wise men, will define success in the same words; yet failure is always described but one way. ***Failure is man's inability to reach his goals in life, whatever they may  be.***\n\nIn truth, the only difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which precedeth all others is-- *I will form good habits and become their slave.*\n\nAs a child I was slave to my impulses; now I am slave to my habits, as are all grown men. \n\nI have surrendered my free will to the years of accumulated habits and the past deeds of my life have already marked out a path which threatens to imprison my future. My actions are ruled by appetite, passion, prejudice, greed, love, fear, environment, habit, and the worst of these tyrants is habit. Therefore, if I must be a slave to habit let me a slave to good habits. My bad habits must be destroyed and new furrwos prepared for good seed. \n\nI will form good habits and become their slave.\n\nAnd how will I accomplish this difficult feat?

Failure, like paiun, is alien to my life. In the past I accepted it as I accepted pain. Now I reject it and I am prepared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the shadows into the sunlight of wealth, position and happiness far beyond my most extravagant dreams until even the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides will seem no more than my just reward. \n\nTime teahces all things to him who lives forever but I have not the luxury of eternity. \n\nYet, within my allotted time I must practyice the art of patience for nature acts never in haste. \nTo create the olive, king of all trees, a hundred years is required. \nAn onion plant is old in nine weeks. \nI have lived as an onion plant. \nIt has not pleased me. \nNoow I wouldst become the greatest of olive trees and, in truth, the greatest of salesmen. \n\nAnd how will this be accomplished? \nFor I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to achieve greatness and already I have stumbled in ignorance and fallen into pools of self-pity. \n\nThe answer is simple. \nI will commence my journey unencumbered with either the weight of unnecessary knowledge or the handicap of meaningless experience. Nature already has supplied me with knowledge and instinct far greater than any beast. in the forest and the value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidly. \n\nIn truth, experience teaches thoroughly yet her course of instruction devours men's years so the value of her lessons diminishes with the time necessary to acquiere her special wisdom. \n\nThe end finds it wasted on dead men. Furthermore, experience is comparable to fashion; an action that proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrow. \n\nOnly principles endure and these I now possess, for the laws that will lead me to greatness are contained in the woords of these scrolls. What they will teahc me is more to prevent failure than to gain success, for what is success other than a state of mind? Which two, among a thousand wise men, will define success in the same words; yet failure is always described but one way. ***Failure is man's inability too reach his goals in life, whatever they may be.***\n\nIn truth, the only difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which precedeth all others is-- *I will form good habits and become their slave.*\n\nAs a child I was slave to my impulses; now i am slave to my habits, as are all grown men. \n\nI have surrendered my free will to the years of accumulated habits and the past deeds of my life have already marked out a path which threatens to imprison my future. My actions are ruled by appetite, passion, prejudice, greed, love,fear, environment, habit, and the worst of these tyyrants is habit. Therefore, if I must be a slave to habit let me be a slave to good habits. My bad habits must be destroyed and new furrows prepared for good seed. \n\nI will form good habits and become their slave. \n\nAnd how will i accomplish this difficult feat? Through these scrolls, it will be done, for each scroll contains a principle which will drive a bad habit from my life and replace it with one which will bring me closer to success. For it is another of nature's laws that only a habit can subdue another habit. So, in order for these written words to perform their chosen task, I must discipline myself with the first of my new habits which is as follows: *I will type each scroll for thirty days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll.*\n\nFirst, I will type the words in silence when I arise. \nLast, I will type the words again just before I retire at day's end, and most important, on this occasion I will type the words fast. \n\nOn the next day I will repeat this procedure, and I will continue in like manner for thirty days. Then, I will turn to the next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thirty days. I will continue in this manner until I have lived with each scroll for thirty days and my reading has become habit.\n\nAnd what will be accomplished with this habit? Herein lies the hidden secret of all man's accomplishments. As I repeat the words daily they will soon become a part of my active mind, but more important, they will also seep into my6 other mind, that mysterious source which never sleeps, which creates my dreams, and often makes me act in ways I do not comprehend. \n\nAs the words of these scrolls are consumed by my mysterious mind I will begin to awake, e3ach morning,with a vitality I have nevver known before. My vigor will increase, my enthusiasm will rise, my desire to meet the world will overcome every fear I once knew at sunrise, and I* will be happier than I ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow. \n\nEventually I will find myself reacting to all situations which confront me as I was commanded in the scrolls to react,  and soon these actions and reactions will become easy to perform, for any act with practice becomes easy.\n\nThus a new and good habit is born, for when an act becomes easy through constant repetition it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is man's nature to perform it often. When I perform it often it becomes a habit and I become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my will. \n\nToday I begin a new life.\n\nAnd I make a solemn oath to myself that nothing will retard my new life's growth. I will lose not a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieved nor can I substitute another for it.

Just as nature mad eno proovision foor my body to toolerate pain neither has it made any provisiono foor my life too suffer failure. Failure, like pain, is alien to my life. In the past I accepted it as I accepted pain. Now I reject it and I am  prpared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the shadows into the sunlight of wealth, positino, and happiness far beyond my most extravagant dreams until even the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides will seem no more than my just reward. \n\nTime teahces all things too him who lives forever but I have not the luxury of eternity. \n\nYet, within my allotted time I must practice the art of patience for nature acts never in haste.

Now I wouldst become the greatest of olive trees and, in truth, the greatest of salesmen. \n\nAnd how will this be accomplished? For IU have neither the knowledgge nor the experience to aciheve greatness and already I have stumbled in ignorance and fallen into pooools of self-pity.\n\nThe answer is simple. I will commence my joourney unencumbered with either the weight oof unnecessary knowledge oor the handicap of meaningless experience. Nature already has supplied me with knowledge and instinct far greater than anty beast in thhe forest and the value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidly. \n\n\tIn truth, experience teaches thoroughly yet her course of instruction devours men's years so the value of her lessons diminishes with the time necessary too acquire her special wisdom. \nThe end finds it wasted on dead men. Furthermore, experience is comparable to fashion; an action that proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrow. \n\nOnly principles endure and these I now poossess, for the laws that will lead me to greatness are contained in the words of these scrolls. What they will teach me is more to prevent failure than to gain success, for what is success other than a state of mind? Which two, among a thousand wise men, will define success in the same words; yet failure is always described but one way. ***Failure is man's inability to reach his goals in life, whatever they may be.***\n\nIn truth, the only difference between those who have failed and thos who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which precedeth all others is-- *I will form good habits and become their slave.*\n\nAs a child I was slave to my impulses; now I am slave to my habits, as are all grown men. \n\nI have surrenderred my free will to the years of accumulated habits and the past deeds of my life have already marked out a path which threatens to imprison my future. My actions are ruled by appetite, passion, prejudice, greed, love, fear, enviroonment, habit,and the woorst of these tyrants is habit. Therefore, if I must be a slave to habit let me be a slave to goood habits. My bad habits mus tbe destroyed and new furrows prepared for good seed. \n\nI will form good habits and become their slave. \n\nAnd how will I accomplish this difficuult feat? THrough these scrolls, it will be done, for each scroll coontains a principle which will drive a bad habit from my life and replace it with one which will bring lme closer to success. For it is another of nature;s alaws that only a habit can subdue another habit. Soo, in order for these written words to perform their chosen task, I must discipline myself with the first of my new habits which is as follows: *I will read each scroll for thirty days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll.*\n\nFirst, I will read the words in silence when I arise. \nLast, I will type the words agaiin just before I retire at da's end, and most important, on this occasion I will read the words aloud. \n\nOn the next day I will repeat this procedure, and I will coninue in likemanner foor thirty days. Then, I will turn to the next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thirty days. I will continue in this manner until I have lived with each scroll for thirty days and my reading has become habit. \n\nAnd what will be accomplished with this habit? Herein lies the hidden secret of all man's accomplishments. As I repeat the words daily they will soo n become a part of my active mind, but moore imporatnt, they wiill also seep into my other mind, that mysterious source which never sleeps, which creates my dreams, and often makes me act in ways I do noot comprehend. \n\nAs the woords of these scrolls are consumed by my mysterious mind I will begin to awake, each morning, with a vitality I have never known befoore. My vigor will increase, my enthusizsm will rise, my desire to meet the world will overcome everty fear I once knew at sunrise, and I will be happier than I ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow. \n\neventually I will find myself reating to all situations which confront me as I was commanded in the scrolls to react, and soon these actions and reactions will become easy to perfoorm, for any act with practice becomes easy. \n\nThus a new and good habit is born, for when an act becomes easy through constant repetition it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is man's nature to perform it often. When I perform it often it becomes a habit and I become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my will .\n\n Today I begin a new life. \nAnd I make a solemn oath to myself that nothing will retard my new life's growth. I will lose not a day from these readingss for that day cannot be retrieved nor can I substitute another for it. I must not, I will not, break this habit of daily reading from thse  scrolls and, in truth, the rfew moments spent each day on this new habit are but a smll price to pay for the happiness and success that will be mine. \n\nAs I read and re-read the words in the scrolls to follow, never will I allow the brevity of each scroll nor the simplicity of its words to cause me to treat the scroll's message lightly. \n\nThousands of grapes are p ressed to fill one jar with wine, and the grapeskin and pulp are tossed to the birds. So it is with thesse grapes of wisdom from the aes. Much has been filtered and tossed to the wind. Only the pure truth lies distilled in the words to come. I will drink as instructed and spill not a drop. And the seed of success I will swallow. \n\nToday my old skin has become as dust.

Nature already has supplied me with knowledge and instinct far greater than any beast in the forest and the value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidly. \n\nIn truth, experience teaches thoroughly yet her course of instruction devours men's years so the value of her lessons diminishes with the time necessary to acquire heer special wisdom.\n\nThe end finds it wasted on dead men. Furthermore, experience is comparable to fashion; an action that proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrow. \n\nOnly principles endure and these I now possess, for the laws that will lead me to greatness are contained in the words of these scrolls. What they will teach me is more to prevent failure than to gain success, for what is success other than a state of mind? Which two,  among a thousand wise men, will define success in the same words; yet failure is always described but one way. ***Failure isman's inability to reach his goals in life, whatever they may be.***\n\nIn truth, the only difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all successs. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which precedeth all others is-- *I will form good habits and become their slave*\n\nAs a child I was slave to my impulses; now I am slave to my habits, as are all grown men. \n\nI have surrendered my free will to the years of accumulated habits and the past deads of my life have already marked out a path whichthreatens to imprison my future. My actions are ruled by appetite, passion, prejudice, greed, love, fear, environment, habit,  and the worst of these tyrants is habit. Therefore, if I must be a slave to habit let me be a slave to good habits. My bad habits muyst be destroyewd and new furrows prepared for good seed. \n\nI will form good habits and become their slave. \n\nAnd how will I accomplish this difficult feat? Through these scrolls, it will be done, for each scroll contains a principle which will drive a bad habit from my life and replace it with one which will bring me closer to success. For it is another of nature's laws that only habit can subdue another habit. So, in order for these written words to perform their chosen task ,I must discipline myself with the first of my new habits which is as follows: *I will type each scroll for thirty days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll.*\n\nFirst, I will type the words in silence when I arise. \nLast, I will type the words again just before I retire at day's end, and most important, on this occasion I will type the words fast. \n\nOn the next day I will repeat this procedure, and I will continue in like manner for thirty days. Them , I will turn to the next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thiryty days. I will continue in this manner until I have lived with each scroll for thirty days and my reading has become hhabit. \n\nAnd what willl be accomplished with this habit? Hereinn lies the hideen secret of all man's accompllishments. As I reaeat the words daily they will soon become a part off my active mind, but more important, they will aslso seep into my other mind, that mysterious source which never sleeps, whichcreates my dreams, and often makes me act in ways I do not comprehend. \n\nAs the words of these scrolls are consumed by my myesterious mindI will begin to awake, each morning, with a vitality I have never known before.My vigor will increase, my enthusiasm will rise, my desire to meet the world swill overcome every fear I once knew at sunreise, and I will be happier than I ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow. \n\nEventually I will find myself reacting to all situations which confront me as I was commanded in the scrolls to react, and soon these actions and reaqctions will become easy to perform , for any act with practice becomes easy. \n\nThus a new and good habit is born , for when an act becomes easy through constant repetition it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is man's nature to perform it often. When i perform it often it becomes a habit and I become its slave and since3 it is a good habit this is my will. \n\nToday I begin a new life. \n\nAnd I make a solemn oath to myself that nothing will retard my new life's growth. I will lose not a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieeved nor can I substitute another for it. I must not, I will not,  break this habit of daiuly typeing from these scrolls and, in truth, the few moments spent each day on this new habit are but a small price to pay for the happieness and success that will be mine. \n\nAs I read and re-read the words in the scrolls to follow, never will I allow the brevity of each scroll nor the simplicity of its words to cause me to treat the scroll's message lightly.\n\nThousands of grapes are pressed to fill one jar with wine, and the grapeskin and pulp are tossed to the birds. So it is with these grapes of wisdom from the ages. Much has been filtered and tossed to the wind. Only the pure truth lies distilled in theowrds to come. I will drink as instructed and spill not a drop. And the see fo ssuccess I will swallow. \n\nToday my old skin has become as dust. I will walk tall among men and they will know me not, for today I am a new man, with a new life. \n\n---\n\nToday I begin a new life.\n\nTooday I shed my old skin which hath too long, suffered the breuises of afailure and the owunds of mediocrity. \n\nToday I am born anew an dmy birthplace is a vineyard where ther is fruit for all. \n\nToday I will pluck grapes of wisdom from the tallest  and fullest vines in the vineyard, for these were planted by the wisest of my profession who have come before me, generation upon generation. \n\nToday I will savor the taste of grapes from these vines and verily I will swallow the seed of success buried in each and new life will sprout within me.\n\nThe career I have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught with heartbreak and despair and the bodies of those who have failed, were they piled one atop another, would cast a shadow down upon all the pyramids of the earth. \n\nYet I will not fail, as the others, for in my hands I now hold the charts which will guide me through perilous waters to shores which only yesterday seemed but a dream. \n\nFailure no longer will be my payment for struggle. Just as nature made no provision for my body to tolerate pain neither has it made any provision for my life to suffer failure. Failure, like pain, is alien to my life. In the past I accepted it as I accepted pain. Now I reject it and I am prepared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the shadows into the sunlight of wealth, position, and happiness faar beyond my most extravagant dreams until even the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides will seem no more than my just reward. \n\nTime teaches all things to him who lives forever but  I have not the luxury of eternity. \n\nYet, within my allotted time I must practice the art of patience for nature acts never in haste. To create the olive, king of all trees, a hundred years is required. An onion plant is old in nine weeks. I have lived as an onion plant. It has not pleased me. Now I wouldst become the greatest of olive trees and, in truth, the greatest of salesmen. \n\nAnd how will this be accomplished? For I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to achieve greatness and already I have stumbled in ignorance and fallen into pools of self-pity.\n\nThe answer is simple I will commence my journey unencumbered with either the weight of unnecessary knowledge or the handicap of meaningless experience.

Now I wouldst become the greatest of olive trees and, in truth, the greatest of salesmen. \n\nAnd how will this be accomplished? \nFor I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to achieve greatness and already I have stumbled in ignorance and fallen into pools of self-pity. \n\nThe answer is simple. I will commence my journey unencumbered with either the weight of unnecessary knowledge or the handicap of meaningless experience. Nature already has supplied me with knowledge and instinct far greater than any beast in the forest and the value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidly. \n\nIn truth, experience teaches thoroughly yet her course of instruction devours men's years so the value of her lessons diminishes with the time necessary to acquire her special wisdom. \n\nThe end finds it wasted on dead men. Furthermore, experience is comparable to fashion; an action that proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrow. \n\nOnly principles endure and these I now possess, for the laws that will lead me to greatness are contained in the words of these scrolls. What they will teach me is more to prevent failure than to gain success, for what is success other than a state of mind? Which two, among a thousand wise men, will define success in the same words; yet failure is always described but one way. ***Failure is man's inability to reach his goals in life, whatever they may be.***\n\nIn truth, the only difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which precedeth all others is-- *I will form good habits and become their slave.*\n\nAs a child I was slave to my impulses; now I am slave to my habits, as are all grown men. \n\nI have surrendered my free will to the years of accumulated habits and the past deeds of my life have already marked out a path which threatens to imprison my future. My actions are ruled by appetite, passion, prejudice, greed, love, fear, environment, habit, and the worst of these tyrants is habit. Therefore, if I must be a slave to habit let me be a slave to good habits. My bad habits must be destroyed and new furrows prepared for good seed. \n\nI will form good habits and become their slave. \n\nAnd how will I accomplish this difficult feat? Through thes escrolls, it will be done, for each scroll contains a principle which will drive a bad habit from my life and replace it with one which will bring me closer to success. For it is another of nature;s laws that only a habit can subdue another habit. So, in order for these written words to perfrom their chosen task, I must discipline myself with the first of my new habits which is as follows: I will read each scroll for thirty days in this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll. \n\nFirst, I will type the words in silence when I arise. \nLast I will type the words again just before I retire at day's end, and most important, on this occasion I will read the words aloud. \n\nOn the next day I will repeat this procedure, and I will continue in like manner for thirty days. Then, I will turn to the next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thirty days. I will continue in this manner until I have lived with each scroll for thirty days and my reading has become habit.\n\nAnd what will be accomplished with this habit? Herein lies the hidden secret of all man's accomplishments. As I repeat the words daily they will soon become a part of my active mind, but more important, they will also seep into my other mind, that mysterious source which never sleeps, which creates my dreams, and often makes me act in ways I do not comprehend. \n\nAs the words of thes scrolls are consumed by my mysterrious mind Iwill begin to awake, each morning, with a vitality I have never known before. My vigor will increase, my enthusiasm will rise,  my desire to meet the world will overcome every fear I once knew at sunrise, and I will be happier than I ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow. \n\nEventually I will find myself reacting to all situations which confront me as I was commanded in the scrolls to react, and soon these actions and reactions will become easy to perform, for any act with practive becomes easy. \n\nThus a new and good habit is born, for when an act becomes easy through constant repetition it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is a pleasure to perform it is man's nature to perform it often. he I perform it often it becomes a habit and I become its slave and since it is a good habit this is my will. \n\nToday I begin a new life. \n\nAnd I make a solemn oath to myself that nothing will retard my life's growth. I will not lose a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieved nor can I substitute another for it. I must not, I will not, break this habit of daily reading from these scrolls, and, in truth, the few moments spent each day on this new habit are but a small price to pay for the happiness and success that will be mine. \n\nAs I read and re-read the words in the scrolls to follow, never willl I allow the brevity of each scroll not the simplicity of its words to cause me to treat the scroll's message lightly. \n\nThousands of grapes are pressed to fill one jar with wine, and the grapeskin and pulp are tossed to the birds. So it is with these grapes of wisdom from the ages. Mucha has been filtered and tossed to the wind. Only the pure truth lies distilled in the words to come. I will drink as instructed and spill not a drop. And the seed of success I will swallow. \n\nToday my old skin has become as dust. I will walk tall among men and they will know me not, for today I am a new man, with a new life.\n\nToday I begin a new life. \n\nToday I shed my old skin which hath, too long, suffered the bruises of failurre and the wounds of mediocrrityyy.\n\nToday I am born anew and myy birthplace is a vineyard where there is fruit for all. \n\nToday I will pluuck grapes of wisdom from thee tallest and fullest vines in the vineyard, \nfor these were planted byy the wisest of myy profession who have come before me, generation upon generation.\n\nThe career I have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught with heartbreak and despair and the bodies of those who have failed, were they piled one atop another, would cast a shadow down uupon all the pyramids of the earth.\n\nYet I will not fail, as the others, for in my hands I now hold the charts which will guide me through perilous waters to shores which only yesterday seemed but a dream.\n\nFailure no longer will be my payment for struggle. \nJust as nature made no provision for my body to tolerate pain neither has it made any provision for my life  to suffer failure. Failure, like pain, is alien to mylife. In the past I accepted it as I accepted pain. Now I reject it and I am prepared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the shadows into the sunlight of wealth, position, and happiness far beyond my most extravagant dreams until even the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides will seem no more than my just reward.\n\nTime teaches all things to him who lives forever buut I have not the luxury of eternity. \n\nYet, within my allotted time I must practice the art of patience for nature acts never in haste.
