Thugh spoken in silence these words will shine in my eyes, unwrinkle my brow, bring a smile to my lips, and echo in my voice; and his heart will be opened. And who is there who will say nay to my goods when his heart feels my love? \n\nI will greet this day with love in my heart. \n\nAnd most of all I will love myself. For when I do I will zealously inspect all things which enter my body, my mind, y sooul, and my heart. Never will I overindulge the requests of my flesh, rather I will cherish my body with cleanliness and moderation. Never will I allow my mind too be attracted to evil and despair, rather I will uplift it with the knowledge and wisdom of the ages. Neverw ill I allow my soul too becoome complacent and satisfied, rather I will feed it with meditation and prayer. Never will I allow my heart t become small and bitter, rather I will share it and it will grow and warm the earth. \n\nI will greet this day with love in my heart. \n\nHenceforth will I love all mankind. From this moment all hate is let from my veins for I have not time to hate, only time to love. From this moment I take the first step required to become a man among men. With love I will increase my sales a hundredfold and become a great salesman. If I have no other qualities I can succeed with love alone. Without it I will fall though I possess all the knowledge and skills of the world. \n\nI will greet this day with love, and I will succeed. ","x":-499,"y":-650,"width":400,"height":400,"color":"2"},
